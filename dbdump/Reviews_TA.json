Okay, waiting is bad, everybody knows this. But the park itself, its very small. You can actually walk all around in what, 10-15mins? This underlines that there is really not so much to offer vs the extensive amount of people visiting it...My advice - if you visiting SG as a tourist, spend your money elsewhere. It is not worth it for one-time visit and you will spend disproportianaly lot money....visiting Universal might make sense in US, but not here..."}

Large open space so you can walk around. Important before visiting - the entrance is in block 1G, on ground floor, right next to the bus stop (not on the terrace). Bring EZ Link card - (that is the plastic metro card available in every 7/11 or metro station, but it is not the paper one-time ticket) \u0026 cash. Ideally small bank notes are you need to pay 6$. You need EZ card to get through the security fence on the roof itself. Regarding the front desk person, for me he was okay. It is not a tourist attraction as such thats why I think is normal. Just know what to bring and you will be fine and enjoy to view.."}

Tips: 1) if travelling around Sri Lanka, spend a few $ extra on having skilled driver (Rizvi), domt consider public transport or renting your own car, its really not worth it and u lose time. 2) Get in touch with Rizvi even before your arrival and try to draw at least a sceleton of what/when you would like to see.

What we liked the most is his really personal approach. From explaining you the theory, then basics movements up to practicing, correction and repeat. Good part is that he always tries to identify what you are doing wrong so that you can learn from it, to make it better the next time. More importantly, it was a lot of FUN surfing with Joao. He is a very friendly guy, after a while we felt more like a friend teaching us surfing rather then some coach telling you what to do. He actually holds a master degree from surfing, what was a nice bonus in comparison to other less professional surf schools. We also liked that he is not rushing into things, but gives you concrete goals for each day so that you can progress with your level. All in all, if you want to learn surfing properly with professional supervision, search for this guy, you have lovely Odeceixe beach at disposal which gives you just the perfect conditions for surfing."}

Regarding hotel there is very little (if something) negative about it - great location right in the city center, nice breakfast, great comfy room (which I suppose looks even better in real than on official booking.com pictures which is pretty rare). Room itself was very modern (at least in the apartments outside of main building), equiped with flat TV, AC, nice bed and balcony. The street below can get pretty noisy but if you close down the windows and turn on AC you can barely hear anything. Otherwise, staying for a while at the balcony and observe street life can be sometimes pretty relaxing after entire day at sun and travelling. Regarding parking, there are many streets where you can park free of charge so dont worry too much about it. I could simply very recommend this hotel as it offers relatively high level of service for the money you pay, especially in the high season. It was definitely the best offer I could have found during this period of year booking 1 month prior arrival. Castellmmare del Golfo itself is a nice port city which is very clean compared to Sicilian standards. It has everything you need besides nice beach in walking distance. But you will find plenty of them in close surrounding. Thus, if you want to stay here, i would recommend to rent a car. With car you can reach many must-sees within 1 hour drive as the highway comes across Castellmmare. In the end, I certainly dont regret staying at this hotel and can recommend it to next travellers."}

What I especially would highlight about this hotel was the behaviour of the personell - always friendly and ready to help you - they made you feel welcomed. Your dining will be also accompained with great waiter Leo who is making a nice friendly atmosphere. Rooms generally well maintained, flat screen TVs, cleaning every day (new towels etc). There is also a beatiful garden around and pool. Probably only minus was a lack of sport facilities in the hotel, but we knew about it in advance therefore we didnt need it. Definitely great value for money. I generally have never come back to the same hotel, but in case of visiting Torremolinos I could make an exception with Los Jazmines. Overall 9.5/10"}

Bedroom has a large robe with in room safe.Housekeeping good and everything clean.We used the pool/spa area - very quiet we were the only ones here.The only negative was that our bedroom had a very strong door of cigarettes - we informed reception so hopefully that was dealt with after we checked out - they did offer to move us but as we only stayed for 2 nights it wasn't worth it to move for the one night left.I would stay at this property again."}

Nice spot for one or two drinks but I definitely wouldn't spend an entire evening here - stay for the sunset but move on to somewhere a little less expensive for dinner and drinks."}

The aqua tonic pool was fantastic, so relaxing.Did a beautiful yoga class in the shala at the cliff top - beautiful place to practice.A trip to Rock Bar to meet friends was nice, but very overpriced.I literally cried when we had to leave, so hard to go back to my 'real life' .

The design makes the most of cross ventilation and a ceiling fan assists this. The villas are beautifully decorated and very comfortable.The gardens surrounding are lush and well cared for - the daybed on the terrace is great for afternoon siestas. The outdoor bathroom with rain shower was lovely. The whole property is well maintained and spotlessly clean.Although not absolute beachfront it is an easy 5 min walk - and the sound of the surf lulled me to sleep each night."}

For the last 4 days of our stay they had a large group of people staying there for a retreat and put on a buffet breakfast instead as they said it was too many people to cater for normally. The buffet was cold on each of the mornings and we really didn't want to eat in the full dining area (poolside was full too). I really don't know why they couldn't have catered for the large group with the buffet and continued their usual breakfast service for their other guests.

We paid double what we were paying in Ubud previously so had some expectations. When we arrived we were taken to our villa but didn't really have a formal check in, we were given no info about anything. The remote was missing for the aircon in one of the bedrooms - so one of the staff climbed on top of the wardrobe (it was very high up) and turned it on as low as possible. We never got the remote so had to sleep in multiple layers of clothing as the room was so cold and we couldn't turn aircon up or off - the beds only had a single sheet, no blankets or doona provided either.We had a problem with the cold tap in the bathroom which was fixed after 2 days - but the hot tap never had a tap attached to it the whole time we were there.Breakfast was basic but was ok - had to wait a long time for someone to appear to take our order every morning though.5 minute walk to the beach - this property is situated at the southern end of Sanur so to get to supermarket and the main shops you need to catch a taxi.Yes there is an esky full of Bintang next to the pool but as a non beer drinker it wasnt a big attraction for me.This place has lots of potential but really needs to work on its maintenance .

They showed us a room that was the same size and I realised straight away it would be too small, they then showed us a much better room. I was given an upgrade at a much reduced rate and the room we eventually checked into was perfect. Spacious, well decorated and the cleanest, nicest room we had had during our month of travelling. With every single interaction we had with the staff they were happy and so helpful. I have stayed in many hotels where I thought the service was great but the St Regis exceeded them all.Breakfast was great and on our last morning the cook was even happy to prepare us some weisswurst that we had purchased at the markets, nothing seemed like too much trouble here.The hotel is in a good location, the train station is right next door, Canada Place and many other attractions are within a walkable distance.I could not fault one single thing with this hotel and if I am fortunate enough to return to Vancouver I will be checking straight in here."}

We took advantage of the free bbqs in the garden and self catered for 30+ people on the Fri pm and Sun am. Staff were friendly and helpful. Kids enjoyed the playground and both the indoor and outdoor pools."}

Got off on the wrong foot - we had asked HAL to call ahead from Denali to ensure that we had sufficient beds for 3 travellers. When arrived only 2 beds, went to reception and said we had asked HAL to call ahead and they had confirmed we would have 3 beds - the lady at reception said quite sarcastically \"they say they called ahead, but they probably didn't \" I then advised her I was present when the call was made - we then received an extra bed. Nothing stand out about this hotel, service and rooms average. The breakfast buffet was much to busy and we ended up with a bagel from Starbucks in the lobby. Good location for walking to nearby shops and restaurants. Room was clean and comfortable."}

Very disappointed with this hotel especially as we have had such good ones prior on this trip. The lobby looks great - but the rooms are horrible. Tiny, outdated and not very clean. We had 3 people staying together and when we got to our room there were two very small double beds. I rang the front desk, explained that we wanted to sleep separately (none of us were a couple) and the beds were too small for two people, they said they would send a rollaway, five minutes later rang me back and said 'sorry we have run out of roll aways' I told them that was not acceptable and they would need to sort it out, miraculously a rollaway was found! After it was put into our room there was probably about 3 inches of space left. The only saving grace for our room was that it overlooked the river.The lobby is quite far from the rooms, they do provide a shuttle but it was inconvenient if you just wanted to pop to the coffee shop for a cuppa.We had a nice meal in the Nenana restaurant. Buffet breakfast in the Sourdough restaurant had a poor choice and was very overpriced . I would not stay at this hotel again."}

We had dinner there a couple of times too, the food was really nice and well priced.My son loved the movies by the pool each night and it was lovely to sit by the fire while he splashed around in the pool.The fitness centre was well equped and there was also a sauna adjacent to this.The hotel provided a free shuttle and we used this to go to Universal and the Metro train station - really easy to get into Hollywood Boulevard from there. If I returned to Hollywood I would stay in this hotel again."}

Very helpful staff at reception, gave us maps and directions for places we wanted to go. Got a really good rate on taxi service to our next hotel ( cheaper than any I had been able to get quotes for on the net)Our room was perfect for us - I was travelling with my mum and my 14yo son - we had 2 queen beds and a pull out sofa- beds were comfortable and clean.There was a small kitchenette which enabled us to stock up at the supermarket and do some self catering which helped our budget.The rooms are dated and a bit musty ( we just opened the window and aired it out) but really you're not here apart from sleeping and getting cleaned up.Breakfast was basic but you could pull together something reasonably healthy - I had fresh fruit with yoghurt , a boiled egg and a bagel each morning - there were also lots of other choices like waffles (my son loved making his own each day) cereals, scrambled egg , bacon and sausages.The main benefit was its proximity to Disneyland, cross the road in front of the hotel and you're there. If I go back to Anaheim in the future I would definitely stay here again."}

Booking was easy via email and they were prompt in replying. Slight delay with pick up at airport - our flight was early and traffic was heavy. First impression of the room was good, very spacious and had traditional Bali decor - beautiful view overlooking the rice padi and monkey forest, bathroom clean and spacious. Unfortunately there was absolutely no privacy - had large windows and glass doors with only very flimsy net curtains, when closed you could still see right into the room - had to get dressed and changed in the bathroom. We were woken up very early every morning as soon as the sun rose. One night I was woken by someone outside the room shining a torch in (hoping it was the security) . Some nights the lights outside our room on the terrace were turned on sometimes not . The room was cleaned daily. Our fridge shelf and bathroom lock both broke and were fixed within minutes.Wifi was free and available in the lobby. It was very fast and never dropped out (very unusual for Bali)Breakfast was included in the price - the food was very nice and they had a good food selection. Downside was that smoking was allowed in the dining room and I personally can't stand it when the people at the next table smoke whilst I am trying to eat . Would be good if they extended the no smoking in the rooms to their dining area.Pool was gorgeous, overlooking the rice padi and just the right temperature. Cappuccinos by the pool was our favourite mid morning ritual ( they have great coffee here too)All in all a nice hotel to stay at - would have rated it higher if had had privacy in our room and no smoking in the dining room."}

Spacious, clean and beautifully decorated. The whole place felt very private, and our terrace was so relaxing. The free shuttle anywhere to and from Ubud was a great service.

The excursions provide a fascinating insight into Bali, the purification ceremony is a real privilege to be part of - the yoga watching the sunrise over the volcano is amazing - the bike ride back to Ubud - the rice field walks - and the most delicious lunch at the organic restaurant in the middle of the padi - all contribute to the entire experience.The people that you meet become friends in such a short space of time - each time I have met a diverse beautiful group from all over the world.The staff at Kumara are absolutely fantastic - I have never felt so cared for as I do there - they anticipate all your needs and everything is done with warmth and friendliness - I do not think you could find better anywhere.

You can easily get a meal with add-ons for under $15.

When we were ordering, we had asked for water, but we were offered tea. We asked if it was complimentary, and we were reassured that it was free. Before payment, we had asked for refills.

The ohmi uni roll is a must to have with every visit to Syun, it is so delicious with the savory fattiness of the ohmi beef and the briny creaminess of the uni.The service was also good, with friendly and courteous severs. The wait for the food also never took too long. Prices however, are slightly steep for the quality and quantity. Not saying that quality is bad, they just do not match up to the prices.The interiors are nice, with dominant wooden accents that make the space really warm and inviting.

We ended up waiting for some 15-20 minutes, only to enter what was a pretty empty dining room. First sign of slow service.After we were seated, it took us a long while before we were able to get hold of a server to take our orders. This was partly because there were no servers walking past our section for a good 5-10 minutes. No table bread was served either. We had ordered their signature steak with sides to share for 4 persons and a bottle of wine after someone finally attended to us. The food took a ridiculously long time to arrive, about 30 minutes or possibly more. When it actually came, we were absolutely stunned by how tiny the portions were. We were promised 1kg by the menu with 250g each, which is a supposed hearty portion that usually fills me up. What we were served however, were two tiny slices each that were much closer to 150g. We wanted to ask about the portions, but there were no servers we could spot, we were starving from the insane wait, and the thought of possibly having to wait even longer for another steak, were daunting factors and we just decided to get with whatever was already on our table done and over with. Aside from the pathetic portions, the taste was very pedestrian with not much flavors if you don't pair with their sauces. If this really was their signature, I would be absolutely disinclined to try anything else on their menu.The interiors were nice, and the only redeeming factor of this restaurant that saved it from a 1/5 rating.Overall, my party and myself were very disappointed. Nonexistent service, unsatisfactory food, and ludicrous waiting times made this an absolutely frustrating dinner."}

They have multiple types of suites available in various configurations; I had stayed in the deluxe suite and the premium suite on multiple occasions, both of which were generous in space. A thing to note is that some of the suites had undergone refurbishment, though I preferred the old suite, partly due to the fact that it had an actual sofa instead of armchairs.The deluxe suite was smaller, but still had a proper separate sitting area. The premium suite was huge, but was not very well appointed. The dining area did not have a sink like in the sitting area of the deluxe suite, and the suite just generally looks very empty with not much furniture or decor in the huge space. The beds in both suites were incredibly comfortable. Bathrooms were identical, with a large freestanding tub and a shower with steam room functionalities. The older suites have a television behind the vanity mirror, but no longer exist in the new suites.The design for both the old suites are rather ostentatious, with very gaudy decor and color palettes. While the newer suites are more muted in their color scheme - an attempt to look more contemporary - it simply ends up looking like a very large cheap hotel room.There are some nice features to the hotel - the premium suites and above allows you to choose from a bath menu, and all suites have 'butler' service. While the butlers usually provide efficient and friendly service, the front counter staff need to improve on their service attitude. What should be warm interactions are usually impassive and robotic.The pool is terrible. Its extremely tiny and the loungers are blocked by a trellis, which makes proper tanning virtually impossible. you need to lie on the ground to get a tan.All the hotels in Resorts World Sentosa have major demerits when it comes to the quality of the facilities. The only hotel with decent pools is Hard Rock Hotel, and the rest have tiny pools with weird layouts. No sauna or steam rooms, tiny ill-equipped gyms. Unless you pay for an Espa facilities day pass.Overall, the gaudy decor matched with the rest of the resort. The entire resort reeks of tastelessness and bourgeoisie. Everything is tacky, service is always lackluster, and everywhere is packed with unruly tourists."}

We had ordered the tuna tatare as our appetizer, which was perfectly seasoned and beautifully plated. The lotus root chips that accompanied the tatare gave the dish a really nice contrast of textures. I ordered the rump as my main which tasted excellent especially for a rump cut, but was a tad overdone for the medium rare I had ordered. I chose the cheese course in favor of a dessert for my third course, which consisted of blue cheese and Brie along with toasted brioche, crackers, and grapes with jam.Overall, Salt Grill in Jakarta is one of the best dining spots not only in the city, but possibly the region. It is far superior to the other Luke Mangan restaurants in Singapore and Australia I had dined at. it truly is a great all rounder with great food, service, interiors, and value."}

While they may have been dethroned by the gulf airlines, and have abysmal service recovery, the lounge is quite nice. Is it the best? Certainly not. But it is nice. As the flagship lounge for Singapore Airlines though, it is a huge letdown. The Private Room should be the standard for business class passengers, and there should be something way more luxurious and opulent to replace The Private Room for First/Suites passengers.The food is nothing special; typical airline lounge food. Decent selection of alcohol but certainly nothing outstanding.The business class side gets pretty crowded quite often, so it's not exactly a sanctuary. Sometimes I would rather visit other lounges as the SilverKris lounge can get quite hectic. The Private Room however, is usually quite peaceful and not crowded.Comparing to other flagship lounges over the world, Turkish Airlines in IST, Emirates in DXB, Air France in CDG, etc, the Singapore Airlines lounges in SIN can't compare to them.That being said, it's still one of the best lounges in Changi Airport, and the best for The Private Room.

The fish was average at best in terms of taste, but there were only 5 pieces in a dish that costed $39. The prawn curry was disastrous. It was very bland with a weird aftertaste, and only came with 4 pieces of prawns costing $39. We had also ordered roti and naan, and like the other dishes, the portions were incredibly tiny. Fortunately, I had the The Platinum Card from American Express, which gave me a 50% discount. But even with the discount, we were still getting little bang for our buck as the portions were ridiculously tiny.Disregarding how overpriced the food was, the flavors Really fell flat overall; even the best dish was just above average.

However, this also means that convenience is compromised. It can be a bit of a journey to visit sights and sites in Bali which are saturated in the Ubud and Seminyak districts. We had tried once to get a taxi back as the private drivers were no longer available and it was an absolute ordeal as most drivers quoted absurd prices or seemed extremely shady. There are also not much attractions around; we tried checking the nearby beach out, but it was rocky and covered with litter.We were travelling in a group of 6 and booked the 3 bedroom villa with a private pool. What was unfortunate was that it had poured on two days we were there and the whole living and dining room had flooded. There are also no shelters to the bedrooms so we had to use umbrellas to get to our respective bedrooms from the living and dining rooms. The only places that are air conditioned are the bedrooms, which gets pretty uncomfortable for us to hang out in the common areas as the tropical weather can get quite unbearable. The roof also leaked in one of the rooms and the water had gotten into my friends' baggage. Fortunately, it did not leave a stain. There were also no tubs in the 3 bedroom villa.Those negatives aside, the staff at The Samata were amongst the most hospitable I have ever experienced. They never failed to make our time as pleasant as possible and always tried to help us with arranging for our private tours and transportation needs.Breakfast was also included, and was healthy but also extremely hearty and delicious. Service can be a little slow, but as usual, very friendly and warm service.The views from two of the rooms in our villa was really pretty, overlooking the paddy fields and the ocean.Overall, the villa and the location was not great. What really stood out however, were the staff who made our trip a truly enjoyable one despite the discomfort and inconveniences. If not for the stellar efforts of the staff, I truly would've given a two star rating based on the villa and location alone."}

While I understand that wear and tear is common, dirt and grime isn't. The whole room needs a professional deep cleaning; there's mould all over the wet areas and some of its fittings, grime on some of the fixtures are very deep and look very unsanitary for me to place my things on. I get that it's not economical or practical for refurbishment of a relatively new hotel, but keeping the environment safe and clean is very much essential.The position of the pool is also terrible. There is no way to tan in the morning and most of the afternoon. Unsure if there is sunlight in the late afternoon. The gym is outdoors and the equipment is not very well maintained.Location is pretty good, with a ton of cafes, restaurants and bars surrounding the property. It's very much accessible to the city via car, but if you're taking public transport it's a bit of a walk. Orchard is somewhat within walking distance (\u003e10mins).Overall, for the price you pay (from approximately US$100 a night) it's pretty decent. However, cleanliness is a serious issue that I am unable to get over."}

The major problem with the hotel was the air conditioning (pictured). The unit sat in the corner and had a pipe going out of the window. When we turned it on, it was loud, very very loud. Unfortunately it was so hot we had to keep the air conditioning on, and subsequently it kept us awake most of the night. The bathroom had no ventilation(or very weak ventilation) and the shower was terrible, low water pressure and the temperature kept fluctuating. The bathroom also showed signs of water damage and is clearly in need of some repairs. We ate breakfast at the hotel one morning and it was expensive for a very small portion, a waste of money. I will not be staying here again."}

Indeed the hotel smelled luxurious and the service was great. However, the complications I had while checking in marred my experience.The Banyan Tree Bangkok is extremely also overcrowded and the lobby can be extremely hectic and rowdy which is very much like hotels that sell rooms to tour groups. The architecture of the building is absolutely abysmal with an extremely tiny pool and virtually impossible to every tan properly due to the limited space, large railings, and positioning of the sun to the building (the pool deck only has some 20-30 tanning beds, which basically means only 10-15 rooms can fit in the area at any given time - less than 5% of their maximum occupancy I believe). The facilities are also pretty limited and pales so much in comparison to many of the other hotels in the same standard.The location is also pretty bad, with no reasonably useful amenities within a comfortable waking distance. Overall, an extremely disappointing stay with Banyan Tree Bangkok."}

Snubbing me by letting my friend taste the wine and not offering me the same does not sit well with me.

Also, he had a really unpleasant disposition, and so did practically all the other kitchen staff, especially the one on the steak (which got very dried out and rubbery after over an hour into service). Service in the back needs to match up with the front, especially so when your kitchen staff interacts with customers. Either that, or scrap live stations and have it completely self serve."}

We generally order Onion Bahji, which is the nicest in Wellington (IMHO), either Afgahani Chicken or Chicken Tikka, both of which are beautiful and moist, followed by a curry each and a naan bread. This generally leaves us with enough to take home for the next day. The restaurant is small and the decor could do with updating. The wine selection is small and some what confusing. After being told they did not have a wine list but I could look in the fridge and pick what I like, I picked a bottle of Oyster Bay sauvignon blanc. The waitress then asked if I really wanted this and perhaps I would prefer a Selaks Pinot Gris. Begrudgingly I agreed, and the waitress disappeared out the back of the restaurant before returning 15 mins later with the wine. While I can't prove it I have a sneaking suspicion she headed to the Countdown across the street to buy it. We finished the bottle of wine and asked for another. The waitress then asked if we were driving as she would not serve us if we were. We explained that we were walking and she went out to get the other bottle. After a glass of this she offered to keep the rest of the wine in their fridge until the next time we visit. We declined and finished it before leaving. We love the food but won't be hurrying back to eat at the restaurant, think we will get take-away and can buy our own wine from Countdown."}

This park seems to be a stop by a number of bus tour companies.It has excellent walk ways and would be ideal for someone who does not want a difficult walk. The park also has a geyser that they let off at 10:15am every day. We planned our trip to arrive at 8:30am walk the whole park and then attend the geyser.

The property was very beautiful with the hotel reflecting its royal past all around. The staff as many other reviewers pointed out were locals who wanted to help us and give their full service but due to lack of training and upgradation they lacked the responsibilities of a good hotel staff. I don't want to say this is a bad hotel as i personally didn't have any bad experience. I would only be able to do a just review by giving points to their different departments as follows:Hotel lobby and premises: 7/10Staff: 6/10Service attitude: 7/10Rooms: 6/10Cleanliness: 8/10Amenities: 6/10Lighting and ventilation: 5/10Breakfast spread: 6/10 (pretty sufficient, although when we came for breakfast on the first day there was nothing on the table but they offered to make for us whatever we want)But we had to skip breakfast as we had an appointment for flying fox ziplining. They upgraded us to a suite room on our visit back from jaisalmer after two days, but the suite was just bigger than the deluxe room and nothing else. So don't go for a suite if you plan to."}

A park where you must to pay a locker during an attraction is the worst thing I have ever saw.... All the rollercoaster need to have a security check and you need to let your bag and other items in a locker before the attraction. Locker who is not free....Are you kidding us?????? Then when the park is crowded you lose your time to find a available locker. I think we lose almost 1h in a day.... It's incredible... In all park I have done we just depose our bag on a case beside the rollercoaster before boarding.... and bring back it at the end....We can't carry any items on board, then we put all in a locker. And what a surprise, at the end of the trip when we see that we must to pay 4 dollars for extra hour ( we didn't do extra hours just wait to the attraction) we can pay because our money is on the bag... It' a jock!!!!! There is no personnel on the locker... and the other locker were totally crowded... The time to find some people to help us the price as increase at 6 dollars... And it was totally mess, there was other people in the same case... Incredible...And we were surprised that all outside attraction closed when a light rain begin.... Never see that...Finally I definitively come back to this park, It's a shame!"}

After a few minutes with them, I realized that it was not distress; they were just really rude and unpleasant people.I had booked the Quaint Queen room, which had no windows, and no comprehension of what a queen bed is either. We ended up in a room with 2 single beds joined together which annoyingly kept shuffling on the wooden floors. Not to mention that this room was worlds apart from the pictures. I'm a skeptic, so I'm always prepared for how a room might look different from the pictures. Naomi Liora brings it to a whole new level. The pictures show a bench, a side table, an accent chair, and still with a respectable amount of walking space. What I had gotten was way over 50sqft cut from that, no chair, no table, no bench. Deceptive marketing at its absolute finest. Aside from the gross misguidance, we had damaged drawers, uneven floorboards, loosening electrical covers, and what is actually a low-end domestic toilet bowl not fit for commercial usage. They also boldly emblazon C.O. Bigelow bath amenities in their pictures, but what you actually get is some strange brand.The rooms have no sound-proofing whatsoever; you can hear everything in the hallway and surrounding rooms. Which means that people can hear you as well. You would think that a claustrophobic room without windows should feel private; again Naomi Liora is pushing boundaries in this aspect.For some strange reason, the hotel feels inclined to vacuum the hallways early in the morning (like 7AM or 8AM). Maybe that's the way they do their morning calls, so they don't have to individually wake each guest up or rush them for checkout.The towels are in a disgusting state, with frayed edges and slightly grayed tint.Throughout our stay, we had never been greeted by the staffers. Perhaps greeted with frowns, but I'm pretty sure that doesn't qualify as a greeting.What actually saves this hotel from complete condemnation is the location. There are a number of great bars and restaurants in the vicinity.In summary, it's a hotel that uses every gimmick in the industry to lure customers in only to let them down and they do it with a nasty frown. My advice, try other hotels nearby if you want this location. It's definitely gonna worthwhile to pay a little more and skip this place."}

You order noodles instead of bread, then add on \"charsiu\" and/or wontons (or other stuff like Asian Scotch eggs). Not too bad an idea, but kind of fails in terms of execution. Firstly, the portion of the noodles are really small. Noodles aren't expensive. Neither did they price it that high. So, is it really worthwhile to make your customers feel shortchanged over such a little sum? The \"charsiu\" was more like a braised rather than roasted pork belly, which ended up as a greasy and overly salted dish. The wontons were so disappointingly lackluster. It was minced meat haphazardly wrapped in wonton skins. The seasoning was pedestrian, and the presentation was disastrous. Also, the filling was very little.I've eaten wonton noodles more expensive than this, and I've also eaten those that cost a mere fraction. However, I have never felt more dissatisfied or shortchanged than I have eating here."}

The host had made two interactions: first to seat, and the second for drinks (which we requested for tap water and no alcoholic drink orders). She had made every effort to ignore us thereafter. A terribly rude and unaware woman. I don't expect stellar service at this price point; I expect basic courtesy and respect.When I had asked for a set menu from one of the servers, she told me that they don't serve sets over the weekends. I made a booking for the restaurant after looking over the menus that were available on their website, as well as the booking app's website. Both of which had clearly stated that the set lunch was available daily. Clearly, this was a case of an unscrupulous business who really pushes the limit of \"subject to changes\".The food, even though I did not get to eat what I was planning to, was decent. I had the pulled pork sliders and truffle fries, which were decent and not expensive. But nothing to rave about whatsoever - it was burger and fries.Would I recommend this place? Personally, I think it's not worth the agony of being subjected to a lack of air-conditioning in this sweltering city and the antics of a very unpleasant host. But if you just want an affordable tapas joint in the city, and you don't care about the experience, then maybe Salt tapas \u0026 bar could be for you."}

Couple that with synthetically patterned stone tiles in the foyer and bathroom and the room would seem to be in a tighter city in a lower tiered hotel.While most of the room was relatively clean, I can't help but to point out some points of concern. Firstly, there was a dead cockroach at the foyer in one of my rooms. Secondly, there were multiple stains on carpet. The printed bathroom tiles are very disappointing aesthetically. A complete waste of perfectly good stone that would've looked much better in its natural state. The beds were also not particularly comfortable.Also, perhaps better quality amenities could be provided. The bath amenities that were provided were June Jacobs brand and made in Malaysia, which are not what you would probably associate with when thinking about luxury hotels.While there were these drawbacks, there were plenty of redeeming factors too. The hotel is extremely convenient, and is practically weather proof. There is shelter all the way from the hotel to the BTS station and the covered walk way that stretches all the way to Siam.The facilities were also great, with a nice outdoor pool and spa facilities (hot tub, cold plunge pool, sauna, and steam room).Service throughout the property is commendable. Staff were warm and personable. Service was proficient; amenities we requested for never took more than 10 minutes.We had the buffet dinner at The Dining Room which was excellent. The spread was good, but what made it stand out was the quality, with very fresh crabs and tasty roasts.The hotel also offered a relatively affordable limousine airport transfer, after we checked out, at 1000 baht (twice to trice more than a local taxi by meter) on an E-Class.Overall, an excellent hotel for practical and business travelers who places convenience and location above all else. But in terms of style and quality, veers on schizophrenic."}

Each one is very nicely done up with hardwood, silk, and stone, and is flooded with light in the day. However, while the greenwall makes a nice touch, we were stuck in a suite that had no windows and two residential blocks opposite which made me feel slightly claustrophobic. Also, apparently only the studios have a nice view of the golf course. Had I known this, I wouldn't have booked my room type. Absolute waste of potential.The housekeepers are really nice and friendly. They're always smiling and greeting whenever they see you. When we leave things lying around they always place it neatly and fold even our clothes.The pool deck is quite picturesque, with an infinity ledge pool, sleek furniture, large open voids. Great to get a tan. There's also a terrazzo steam room, and lockers, in the changing room.Breakfast was not too shabby, focusing on quality over quantity. You get to order eggs off the menu, ensuring its freshness and quality.Location wise, it is really close to the BTS, but walking to the big malls like Siam Paragon and Central World can take a while. They're definitely still within walkable distance for me though. Seems much shorter in theory, but feels way longer when you've to deal with Bangkok traffic and construction. Getting to places via BTS is very easy though, with the station right in front of St. Regis.Try out Biscotti at Anantara (formerly Four Seasons Hotel) which is right in front of Hansar. They've a great set lunch with an amazing antipasti table that is stocked with Parma ham, foie gras terrine, nice selection of cheeses, and so much more. The lamb I ordered for my main course was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Mains are on the small side, so fill up on the antipasti if you've a big appetite. A must visit in Bangkok!Overall, the Hansar is a great place to stay, with beautiful esthetics throughout the property and great service. A downside is probably that they don't state clearly what kind of views you get, which kind of ruined it for me as I thought the suite would have city views or the golf course view."}

The room itself was bit small but very trendy having ceiling to ground mirror on one side of the foyer and huge full size window offering great views of the city. Each \u0026 every aspect of the room has been carefully designed. The room had buttons like Day light, Night Light, Dream Light, etc. (instead of switches), and all the lights in the room (including bathroom) are concealed to give a trendy look. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The room had all possible amenities in it including free in-room bar which are replenished everyday with drinks \u0026 snacks. The hotel service was excellent, and housekeeping service is done twice daily. The complimentary breakfast was widespread but with very limited Indian dishes.

As a silver member of Etihad guest program I am entitled for one additional bag up to 23 Kgs on the piece concept basis in addition to two bags and this is clearly mentioned in the Etihad Airways website. However, on my return trip when I went to check in for Etihad Airways flights at Los Angeles airport, I was told by the ground staff that the third bag is not allowed even though I gave them my Etihad silver card. A female supervisor was called by the check in staff and she also repeated the same. When I showed them on my cell phone what is mentioned in the Etihad website under benefits for silver members, the supervisor agreed to check it by herself and then she consulted with the male supervisor who was initially reluctant and later upon checking they agreed to let in the third bag after some time. The wait was quite agonizing for me and traumatic, as I had brought third bag only upon reading the benefits for silver members in the website. I must state that the attitude of the ground staff which I observed in general was not good but in some cases rude. One of the rule was that the hand carry should not exceed 7 Kgs and it is also good to enforce that. But not to the extent that the ground staff inform passengers sternly and make them uncomfortable. It can also be dealt politely. Also, while boarding the flight, a male ground staff wearing a suit and looked more like a supervisor, calling passengers in a condescending attitude to make a que to board the flight. In addition, he was lifting the hand carry baggage to each passenger to check its weight, even though I really donât understand if anything can be done at that stage except increasing stress levels of passengers. Overall, the ground staff looked just average.Now let me say something about inflight experience. The service in flight from Abu Dhabi to Los Angeles was very good and I must mention the name of flight steward Mr. Michal who was serving with a smile in our aisle as excellent whereas others were OK. On my return flight from LAX to Abu Dhabi, the air hostess who was serving in our aisle was excellent and very nice with passengers. However, the attitude of others were bit rude and looked jaded and tired. Overall it was an average experience even though I had an option of travelling by Qatar Airways as I had already travelled by other airlines (Saudia, Emirates \u0026 American)."}

It is better to buy the ticket online which is less expensive than buying directly from the ticket booth. The elevator from ground floor to 124th floor takes a min. The view from the top is breathtaking especially on the clear day. Also, use the modern TV telescope which are provided at different places for free use of visitors. Thru this one can zoom in at certain place and can see 4 different views: day view, night view, live and historic (that particular place before many years ago). On the floor 124 there is a open gallery as well as closed space where a gift shop is located. Things over here are very pricey.

The hotel location is excellent as it is located in Cotai strip of Macau, adjacent to Holiday inn and opposite to The Venetian. Also, City of Dreams which includes Hard Rock hotel is around 5 mins walk from the hotel. This hotel is the largest among Sheartons in the world comprises of two towers i.e. Sky Tower \u0026 Earth Tower and has around 30 plus floors each. The ground floor is interconnected with the Holiday Inn hotel and Cotai Sands Shopping. On the 3rd floor of Cotai Sands shopping (also connected thru sky tower) many fast food restaurants are located (including Aruna Indian Restaurant). The hotel provides complimentary coach service from Macau Harbour as well as Cotai ferry station. Also it provides coach service to Macau attractions located on the Macau side. The check in process took around 20 mins and needs to be streamlined so that it can be made faster. The checkout was much faster and can also be done thru TV. The room tariff was pricey (even though it was weekday) as I had booked the room only 2 weeks in advance as well as for its location. Our room was in 28th floor in sky tower. There are many elevators in the sky tower and are pretty fast. The room was of reasonably good size and had all amenities in it. But room was not trendy. Bed \u0026 pillows were was quite comfortable Bathroom was big having both stand in shower as well as bath tub but the design is outdated. The room has large windows and view from was very good. The hotel has many restaurants and the morning breakfast was in Feast Restaurant (which was part of the room package) located in earth tower. The breakfast which was quite ok comprised of many varieties including continental and vegetarian varieties. The hotel also has a casino on the ground floor.

The main reason for booking this hotel apart from location, it is an Expedia VIP access hotel and I am Expedia Gold member. Hence I had used my Expedia points for 3 night stay at this hotel along with my wife. Right from the check in until check out it was truly memorable romantic experience. At the time of check in, we were explained all the privileges we have as a Expedia gold member which included room upgrade, complimentary in room bar, discounted breakfast, extended check out time until 2 PM, spa upgrade package, etc. We were given room with the best view (Kowloon Park) in 10th floor. The hotel welcomes its visitors with orchid smell and it is a truly designer hotel. All its facilities starting from restaurants to swimming pool along with Jacuzzi are amazing. The location of this hotel is excellent as it is in Nathan Street, close to many attractions and surrounded by shopping malls. MTR is about 5 min walk.The room was of reasonable size and had all possible designer amenities in it. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The bathroom was glass walled and had separate walk in rain \u0026 hand shower and bath tub. The room had different mood lightings to create romantic ambience. Each and every aspect of the room is designer including chair, cutlery, etc. The infinity pool and Jacuzzi are really fantastic and welcoming. Apart from being a designer hotel, its entire staff starting from reception to housekeeping is truly exemplary and always welcomes people with a smile.One thing the hotel can improve to do something to reduce the sound from the adjacent rooms which are clearly audible especially at night time.Due to lack of time we were not able to use hotel spa. Overall it was right choice and we truly enjoyed our stay and would certainly stay at this hotel if we visit HK next time. Also, the hotel may appeal to Muslim travelers as there are many halal restaurants nearby.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Rooms on 10th floor overlooking Kowloon park are good\nSee more room tips"}

This was my second trip to South Lake Tahoe in last 1 year. Last time I had stayed in Harrahâs which a multistory building, and this time we stayed in Best Western which is more of lodge type where one can park right in front of their room. This time our main criteria for choosing hotel apart from close to attractions \u0026 3+ star rating, were free Wi-Fi, free parking \u0026 complimentary breakfast. The hotel location is perfect country side setting and is just few hundred feet from entrance to Heavenly Ski Resort and close to Harrahâs and other casinos. The Hotel check in staff was excellent and she checked us in even though we arrived couple of hours before check in time. But as the room was not ready we were not able to go to our room. Instead we got fresh by using the washroom facilities in the reception before visiting Heavenly Ski Resort. It is better to park the car at the hotel (during daytime) if one is visiting the Heavenly Ski Resort. The room was neat \u0026 tidy and similar to the rooms of other Best Western hotels where we had stayed but the size of the room and the bathroom were comparatively smaller. The bed were cozy and comfortable. The room had all the amenities which usually the Best Western hotels have. The hotel pool is small and is outdoors but we did not use it because of the cold weather as well as lack of time. The complimentary breakfast (which has been rated as 100 best breakfast in US) was just extraordinary even though it is on order (not buffet) thru a set menu where one can choose one dish with coffee/tea. The greeting and explanation of the menu by the restaurant manager to each and every guest upon entrance is something one will remember. The hotel steward Brad who served us the breakfast was also equally excellent.

We stayed here for 2 nights and it was good experience. The Ocean View deluxe room was on the 4th floor of with a very nice view of the ocean as well as the cliff. It is perfect setting for couples. The room is of reasonably good size with a mini Jacuzzi tub in the balcony with all possible amenities. The bed and pillow were very comfy and the bathroom was with glass walls and with blinds from inside. The hotel offers complimentary breakfast which is reasonable but could be better. The hotel service right from reception to housekeeping is excellent. The swimming pool is small but nice. The tours booked thru tour desk is higher priced than booked outside. The hotel has its own 'Beach Club' which is about 8 minutes drive and has a to \u0026 fro free shuttle from the hotel. But it does not have anything other than dirty beach and could be avoided. In fact it was quite boring to spend 2 hours over there as the pick up shuttle was after 2 hours of dropping. The hotel spa is very good but pricey.

Our room had all possible amenities a five star hotel offers including coffee/tea maker and the size was also very good. The sleep quality is excellent with king size bed with 4 pillows. The bathroom is separated from the toilet with an empty space in between for seating and changing purposes. The bathroom has glass ceiling to floor on both sides with blinds in it on one side. The hotel offers complimentary breakfast at the lobby level and quality is pretty good. The hotel is very close to many Indian, Arabic \u0026 other restaurants. The hotel service at all quarters is excellent and as the lakeside wing is little far from beachside wing we used hotel complimentary tuk tuk service whenever we came from outside.

Our trip to South Lake Tahoe was quick getaway before an educational conference in Anaheim. Having travelled 17 hrs non stop flight to LAX and after 8 hrs drive to South Lake Tahoe, we were looking for comfortable stay at Harrah's which was pre-booked. It did not disappoint us. Before I made the booking, I had read reviews in trip advisor of this hotel as well as other nearby hotels. The reviews of this hotel were mixed and among the four star hotels in south lake Tahoe the price of this hotel was very reasonable. The check in was smooth and quick and we were given neat and clean and quite spacious room on the 8th floor with a partial view of the lake, city and the mountains. One of the unique feature of the room which I have not seen in any hotel I had stayed in different countries is that it has two full size bathrooms. Apart from this, there are so many mirrors some of them full size both inside the room as well as in the bathroom that it can give complex to people who need to shed some extra fat. The bed and pillows were quite comfortable and illumination inside the room was quite right. The furniture and carpet were little bit dated but quite ok. The Hotel has a casino along with restaurants in the ground and mezzanine floors. Also, it has Starbucks near the reception. The Gandola to Heavenly ski resort is about 5 min walk from the hotel and hence it is better to park the car in the hotel itself while visiting Heavenly Ski Resort or Shopping Area. Fastfood Majors such as Burger King, Subway, etc are also in this area. As the Hotel is located in the state of Nevada and when we step out of one of extreme left hotel entrances, we immediately step into the state of California. Overall I would certainly stay in this hotel as apart from being an excellent hotel in a very good location, after dark one can spend some time in the hotel casino, restaurant, window shopping, etc compared to most of the other nearby hotels which do not offer any activity after dark.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Hotel on the higher floor with lake view is better\nSee more room tips"}

Our group comprised of 3 kids and the members varying from 45 yrs to 10 months, so one can imagine the varied interests. We spent our entire time in the resort itself and I must say it was time well spent by all the members including my 10 month old infant as we utilized all the resort facilities such as Swimming pools, Beach, fun zone as well as family activities. And I especially would like thank the event organizer Mr. Ashok with whom we had a great time The location of the resort is in south Goa which is far from sightseeing places and happening beaches in North Goa. Also, there is not much to see in South Goa. The resort is excellent for families or couples alike. One of the highpoint of the resort are their staff in all areas who provide truly exceptional and prompt service comparable with the international standards (similar to Hilton Hawaiian Village, Honolulu which I had reviewed before) . The restaurants are good but pricey as it is expected at any five star property. The only negatives were the room floor which used to become damp when the balcony door was kept open and the bed sheets were not smelling good maybe because of monsoon. Overall it was an memorable vacation and my kids were not satisfied and wanted to extend it which was not possible because of our tight schedule. We would certainly visit this property again\n\n\nRoom Tip: Studio or two bedroom apartments are better than the individual room which is quite smaller in size.\nSee more room tips"}

The bathroom is just awkward ....the door to toilet opens in the wrong direction and the toilet itself is infront of a clear glass window! The bed is comfortable though and the finish is high end. Our deal with Luxury Escapes gave us executive club benefits ...which in the main worked out well however a couple of mornings breakfast was far from acceptable. Too many people in the club lounge meant we couldn't find a cleared table or indeed cutlery and struggled to find enough food to eat. Not the best start to the day. The layout here is also rather awkward in that people have to line up for the egg bar in front of the breakfast buffet blocking access to other guests. Either move the egg bar into a more central location (maybe one of those impractical perspex boxes?) or set the hot breakfast buffet elsewhere. On the plus side we found the staff to be very helpful ,,,, but frankly when Hazel wasn't there that breakfast scenario was a nightmare!\n\n\nRoom Tip: You probably want to get a room on a higher floor to appreciate the view\nSee more room tips"}

This was our penultimate leg of our long trip which included 6 days in Las Vegas. I insisted on staying here as it is considered to be an iconic hotel and the room tariffs were very cheap since it was midweek. But what we discovered was rather a hotel room (the tower which we got was in the old building near check in area) which is seriously in need of refurbishment. It was far from four stars and it is certainly a rip off for those who stay here during weekend as the room tariffs exceeds 300$ nightly. Starting from the elevator which was very small and old to the corridor which was very narrow, everything was not up to the mark. The room interiors were showing their age and are in need of change. The room was rather spacious and the bed was quite comfortable. The view which we got was the inside view where one can see Caesars statue and adjoining fountain. The hotel lobby and the casino in the new area are good. Also, pier shops area is nice. Overall it was certainly not a very good experience considering the fact that it is an iconic hotel in Atlantic City."}

As a honors member, our room was upgraded to Junior Suite which had all the amenities. The room was very comfy and sleep quality was excellent. The hotel has health club and swimming pool along with heated whirlpool. The hotel itself is in need of refurbishment as carpets and the lamps has become old but it does'nt matter as long as it is clean. The only downside is the parking rates which are 33$ per day which is quite expensive. I will certainly stay in this hotel is I visit Philly again.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Rooms in the seventh floor is better as it is closer to Swimming Pool and Health Club\nSee more room tips"}

The location is fantastic as it is close to many restaurants (located in lexington ave) and shopping areas such as Macy which is half a mile from the hotel. This is a boutique hotel which has huge round shaped marine aquarium and a beautiful corridors. The check in was not very smooth as we were in for shock when the reception staff told us they could not locate our booking which was done thru expedia even though we had the confirmation, and there are no rooms available at that time. After talking to expedia directly, the matter was finally resolved at the intervention of the Hotel Manager, Mr. Benjamin who informed us personally that we will will able to check in and our room will be upgraded to superior room. He also apologised for the delay which lasted for about Hour and half. The room was in the sixth floor, corner of the buliding with full size windows on both sides which provided excellent view on both sides outside. It had hitech features such as mirror with lights and small TV screen in it in the bathroom, bath tub with Jacuzzi, button to open curtains near the bedside, electronic display button for do not disturb \u0026 for house keepin, etc. The mattresses and the pillows were fantastic and the lights in the room were excellent and much more than sufficient. As our flight was late in th evening, the hotel cocierge staff were glad to keep our luggage in the storage area. At the the time of check out, Mr, Benjamin, Hotel manger enquired about our stay at the hotel and informed that he is looking forward to welcome us at the hotel next time. One area of improvement is certainly the reception staff who I think should be more friendly and provide service with a smile. I will certainly stay here next time I visit New York.\n\n\nRoom Tip: The rooms near the corner of the building provide excellent views\nSee more room tips"}

The castle is built on a hill amid scenic surroundings. The trip to the castle from the visitor center takes around 15 min bus ride which itself is quite scenic. The interior of castle is majestic and is painstakingly preserved. The castle is surrounded by beautiful gardens. There are many photo opportunities s around the castle. The downside of inside tour of castle is that only 3 rooms are shown to the visitors and takes less than 30 min. Later one can see the Roman pool which leads to the bus stop for the return ride to the visitor center. In addition to the tour, there is a 45 min show in the IMAX Theater which is more about Mr. Hearstâs legacy rather than the construction of the castle itself, and can be avoided if the time does not permit. Overall it is certainly not a must see attraction but can be visited at least once for someone like us who have never seen a castle anywhere before."}

Also, the bathroom is very small. The hotel offers complimentary breakfast and also complimentary coffee/tea in the evening. In addition, luggage can be kept with concierge in case of early check in or check out. There are some good restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel. As for shopping, there is Macyâs which is supposed to be largest departmental store in the world and it becomes more attractive especially during sale period.

I have tried these tours in Sydney which was so amazing so I had really high expectations. We had booked all the 3 tours: Grand Tour, Tour of Christianshavn and Classical Tour, but here I will only talk about two of them and then the 3rd in another review, and this is because we had the same guide on these two tours. Magnus.As I said we had very high expectations and OMG they weren't let down at all. Magnus was so funny, and you craved for more so 3 hours weren't enough for the Grand Tour lol. If you don't like danish humor and sarcasm, then don't join in, because these tours are full of it, and that is what makes them great compared to other tours. I loved that it was a dane that was our guide, because I was a little sceptic with some of the guides not beeing danes, so how can they tell from a danish perspective with all humor and non-said things like Danes hate the Swedens, every dane knows that, so for me beeing a Dane it was so fun that Magnus took this as a red line through the tour. Magnus did an amazing job at borh the Grand Tour and Tour of Christianshavn, he even after the Christianshavn tour did a little unofficial tour outside Christiania to point out the good spots inside, for dinning and so.I have a friend coming from Indonesia soon, and I hope that when she arrives Magnus would be our guide as well, because as I could understand every guide has their own unique tour and own unique way to tell about the places. So cross my fingers!!!! Thank you for two amazing tours Magnus #Swedenistheenemy :P"}

So what they could do is learn from the japanse that the door swings out insted of in to the bathroom. One other bad thing was the breakfast buffet, every single hotel serves bacon no matter what!!! So they choose not to serve bacon which is a breakfast favourit, because they were under renovation, excuse me that is no excuse to not serving bacon for eggs at breakfast which is an all time favourit and more important than the sausages they served, and in Denmark bacon is very important!!! Also the breakfast buffet was very borring and the pastry tasted funcky not like the pastry in Jylland, also no sugar for the breakfast products, you had to ask for it. Other than that the staff is very friendly, and you could storrage your luggage for free until your department time, even though you had checked out, so that was great.

The hotel can be a little hard to find, and there is not many to ask for the location, but I was lucky to find a nice man showing me to the hotel. The hotel staff are so friendly and helpful there is nothing negative at all, they help you with everything from arranging prepaid tickets to the forbidden city, bus travel to the great wall, and even help with ordering McDonalds food online. Also when getting up early they prepare a lunchbag for you. The only negative thing is that they only have two choices of breakfas western and chinese, and when you are a picky eater like me it ain't that much to like, but it looked interessting and I usually ordered the chinese breakfast, which is a different one every day.I had a huge room in the basement, with both a living room and a bedroom. It was a western styled room, but I most say if you stay at this hotel try to book the chinese rooms, they are so beautiful, also I most say traveling by myself the room was to huge for me alone. Also you get free bottle water every day.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Rooms in the basement has only a roof window. Book a traditional room\nSee more room tips"}

When I stayed here in July last year they were still renovating the lobby so a lot was to desire and I didn't get to see the Hotels full potential. My room was including breakfast, but as this area also was under renovation, they gave me gifts cards to Starbucks instead, the problem was that it was only for 10S$, and it was impossible to get both something to eat and drink for that price, and I am not a big fan of starbucks. It is in a really nice area not far from Little India and not far from the metro either (well it depends where you are from, but for me 10 min walk to the metro isn't that far).The rooms was clean and the staff really helpfull and sweet. They had an amazing TV package with some HBO channels for free, so I even ended up having a day at the hotel just watching HBO movies.I can warmly recomment this hotel, and I will look forward to visit it sometimes with the new name and look ;)"}

But he room was good, you had 4 towels, free water and a huge bathroom and a fridge and a TV and a nice balcony.The next day we sadly had to go back to the room we upgraded from. If you don't need much this room would be perfect for you, but if you are like me, who can't live without a TV don't choose a standard room, because there is no TV, and only 2 bath towels, no free water and you will have a bug problem in the toilet with corchruges, and then you probably like me would wake up to a 15 cm huge jungle spider in the bathroom erw! Also the room don't have any air condition or ventilation in the bathroom. The bed also only had one bedsheet, compared to the deluxe room which had 3...Well the staff is friendly, but the breakfast is lowsy, there is only a few choices, and you can't choose something cold to drink like milk or juice, only tea and coffee.

The problem with the pictures was just that the room was just made like that for the sake of the promotion pictures of the Hotel...Seriously that is not okey at all, because people are choosing their hotel on behaf of the pictures that are published, and so my friend did tell them...The manager was very sorry and in half and hour we got another room actually exactly the same room they used for the pictures, and they even hang up pictures as a bonus. What I do not understand is why they don't make their standard rooms more comfy like the pictures they show, it is the small things that counts and the ones that makes a huge difference...another thing is that the bathroom smelled absolutely horribel, but it was because of the water and not the hotels fould...also a little ant problem, but I think that actually count for every damn house in Indonesia to have problems with ants...The staff was very friendly...But their breakfast could wish for more to desire, but it was okey...\n\n\nRoom Tip: demand what you paid for.\nSee more room tips"}

As it was my wife's first visit to Hawaii as well as to US, I wanted to make it something special for her. Having already seen the hotel during a conference in 2005, I chose this hotel as it is a complete holiday destination by itself since everything from restaurants, shopping arcade, convenience stores, 2 starbucks, 4 pools to Beach, lagoon pool, Atlantis Submarine, beautiful landscaping with birds, etc are right on hotel premises. I did not regret my decision of choosing this hotel as being honors member; we got a complimentary upgrade from room to suite in Diamond Tower with an extended balcony which is only on 14th floor of the tower. The balcony had two long chairs as well as two normal chairs with coffee table. The views from the balcony were fantastic as on one side it was Waikiki Beach view and other Honolulu City view along with the hills in the background. The bedroom as well as living room were very spacious and had all basic necessities in it including TV in both the rooms. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and sheets used were as good as new. The Waikiki beach area where shopping malls are located is about a mile from the hotel and one can easily walk there. Also, at the Hotel there is Hawaiian dance show followed by fireworks on Fridays near the super pool area where 20$ each is charged for pool chair which is certainly not needed as one can easily view the show from the pool area. As for the cons, the restaurants are rip off as on first day we took 2 croissants and one coffee for 15 US$ from Starbucks. It is better to get breakfast items from ABC Convenience Store located in the hotel premises and have the complimentary coffee which is provided in the room. As for meals, one can walk short distance to some good nearby restaurants which are reasonable. Also, the one day circle island tour which was booked for us by the hotel travel desk was not so good, as I had taken much better tour during my previous visit. After 3 day stay we felt as if it was very short trip and were longing for more, and we could not extend it as we had to go to other places in California. Finally, yes.. we will certainly stay at Hilton if we visit Hawaii again.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Rooms with extended baclony on 14th Floor of Daimond tower are excellent\nSee more room tips"}

The suite which had bedroom with king size bed and a living room were very spacious and accommodates 4 persons. In addition to swimming pool the resort has gymnasium, steam bath, jacuzi and sauna and it's use is complimentary for resort residents. The offer included sumptuous breakfast. The only drawback is it's location which is in South Goa and is very far from happening north Goan beaches like Baga and Calungute. Also it is better to have own transportation in order to go around Goa. One additional benefit for resort residents is that they can also use facilities such as beach, swimming pool, Casino, etc in much bigger White Sands by Zuri resort located approximately 2 kms from retreat.\n\n\nRoom Tip: As it is a all suite resort, suites overlooking the swimming pool are better compared to others\nSee more room tips"}

We wanted to try the dim sum at Bao Luo Wan Xiang, which was fantastic and cheap ($1 for char skew bao!!). We also wanted to try the katsu curry from Yakitori and Teppan Azmaya but it was unfortunately closed. We decided to go for some satay from just outside on Satay St (a little row of satay stalls, we went for stall 7) and it was pretty good. You can buy a variety of drinks from the central stall, but we stuck with beers.The stall owners aren't particularly pushy, but I'd recommend having an idea of what you want to try before getting there.

We visited and the queues are crazy. Once inside, the walking trails are great, and there are definitely a few cool exhibits (the bat enclosure stands out for me). The tram is supposed to be a great way to see more, but the queue looked like it was going to take upwards of an hour so we didn't wait. I don't think this was helped by the tram stops mostly being closed with only the one at the entrance being available on the night we visited. I think if we did this again, we'd pay for the queue jump for the trams. If you only have time for this, or the zoo, I'd say go for the zoo. It's definitely better."}

We paid for the express passes and would definitely recommend this, the queues can be pretty long.There's good mix of rides and attractions for everyone, but it probably leans more towards families. That being said, we enjoyed our visited as a couple without kids. The food prices aren't too expensive considering you're in a theme park. The Sentosa express links well with the MRT and buses if you plan on getting public transport. We didn't explore more of the Sentosa resort, but there looks like a lot of other things going on if you wanted to leave the park and re-enter which you can do."}

There seems to be a strong emphasise on education and conservation here. A very clean and well laid out zoo, there's a good mix of animals and presentations.We booked our tickets online so skipped any queues on site. We probably spent around 3-4 hours happily wandering around the enclosures. Highlights were the elephant show, the monkey enclosures, and the reptile house. The animals are penned in so to speak, but have large enclosures to move around in. You will actually walk in amongst the animals in some of the areas (my wife getting a fright as a large iguana crossed her path at one point out of nowhere to example). We grabbed some lunch at Ah Neng Bistro, an outdoor eating area near the orangutan, and polar bear enclosures, with both of us having curry (one chicken, one veg) served in hollowed out bread bowls. They were both fantastic and reasonably priced, especially for somewhere like a zoo. I'd probably recommend visiting here over the night safari if you can only do one. It's much less crowded."}

Very clean, and the bed was huge! All staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. The location is a 10 or so minutes walk from Orchard St, but less than 5mins to the Newton subway, and Newton food market. I'd recommend borrowing an umbrella from the concierge if you don't have one with you to save from getting caught in a Singapore rain shower.

There is also only valet parking, something the website doesn't make completely clear, and at $24, it's not the cheapest. Check in went fine, though it's not the tidiest of hotel receptions. The bar is next door to it which is nice, but only had one person serving and running the kitchen. The menu is very, very limited, but what they had was good. The rooms are a good size, pretty modern with a little kitchenette off to one side. Very clean, and looked recently refurbished. My only complaint with the room is that the bathrooms only had a light above the mirror, no ceiling light which made an evening shower, not totally dark, but i'd have preferred it lighter. I'd stay here again if I book late like I did this time, and budget is an issue, but there are definitely better hotels in this budget in the area."}

A colleague recommended Purple Gables B\u0026B so I went for it. Lynda, the owner, got back to me very quickly regarding my booking and took my payment details over the phone. She asked about breakfast options etc in advance. The accommodations are a little suite style on the side of the house with a large living room/bedroom with dining table, sofa and chairs, and behind a screen, a large double bed. There was a second single room and a private bathroom. Lynda had made me a zucchini bread on arrival and there were loads of snacks available if you got hungry. It was very reasonably priced. My only mild criticism is that there is no wifi. Not the end of the world, and it was nice to be a little cut off from work but something to consider."}

When checking in the receptionist was chatty and although the lobby was a bit tired, we thought it'd be fine for two nights. We were directed to a room above the reception and it was grubby, small, and although it had been cleaned, it just felt dirty. Mould on the walls, windows marked, just unpleasant. The bathroom wasn't much better but the final straw was it having no shower. What kind of hotel in this day doesn't have showers?! My partner asked to be moved to a room with a shower as she was a bridesmaid and wanted to wash her hair before the wedding. I was just bemused that they didn't have one, and hate baths. The receptionist looked at her like she was crazy asking for a shower but managed to move us room (others in the wedding group were not so lucky). The second room was fine, not great but fine. It was fairly cheaply finished but it was at least clean. Again the furniture was a bit tired and the flooring in the bathroom had been torn and repaired with some duct tape. If you HAVE to stay here, then ask for a room in the extension where this one was. Breakfast was ok, nothing special though it was at least part of the room rate. Staff didn't seem to be all that fussed about customers, and coming for breakfast seemed to be a hindrance for them. Friends of ours stayed in the B\u0026B next door which looked amazing. If you're coming to Strathpeffer, stay there. Or the little retreat B\u0026B up the hill, or anywhere else. Inverness, Dingwall, commute from Edinburgh if you have to!"}

It seemed to be a lovely little hotel. I was more than a little disappointed by it.The room itself was a little tired, though I suppose that could be the look the hotel is aiming for. The shower was awful, with the shower head at my chest height (and I'm not the tallest guy!). The room was also incredibly noisy, with a function room directly below. Being in town for a conference meant it was being used for breakfast briefings which meant for 2 days straight I was woken up at 630am by the noise. Credit where it's due, the breakfasts were amazing, especially the wild west eggs benedict but the service wasn't great to be honest. I had lunch one day and that was pretty poor with undercooked, limp fries. I was really looking forward to staying here, and the location is great but next time I'm in San Diego, I'll stay elsewhere despite its great location."}

We weren't sure how many wings to order so went for 10 each and a portion of waffle fries to share with cheese on the side. The wings were amazing. We had the medium which were your standard buffalo sauce and a portion of garlic too. The garlic ones were nice, not something I'd have ordered on my own so I was glad my other half did. The bar itself is nice enough with a large number of TVs on the wall for watching sport, but not intrusively so. It's a little out of the way on 79th but it's totally worth the trip.

The lobby area is clean and welcoming and though we didn't use the bar/restaurant, it looked good. The staff were on the whole very helpful and pleasant however my one criticism of our stay would be the concierge staff. When trying to organise our return to the airport they were very pushy about using their shuttle service. I travel very frequently in and out of the USA internationally and they kept trying to tell us we'd miss our flight if we left when I planned. One staff member outright lied and told me \"yellow cabs don't take luggage, you'll have to use our shuttle or town cars\".

The restaurant was ok for breakfast but expensive for the other meals. Staff ranged from friendly (english speaking receptionist who checked me in) to completely disinterested and rude (restaurant staff).My biggest issue was this hotel was the internet access. It styles itself as a business hotel but I struggled to download my emails most of the time and frankly the staff didn't seem interested when I complained. Speaking to other guests, this was the same case when they complained. I probably won't be staying here again on my next trip to Sao Paolo."}

It surpassed any expectations I had!Where to start?! We had to ship a large amount of freight from overseas to the Gladstone, no problem it was all waiting in our rooms for us arriving. We also asked if we could store some while we went to a couple of nearby cities before returning. Again, no problem. Any reasonable request was met with the same relaxed helpful approach.Arrival was fine, getting checked in easily and a room being available before check in time. The rooms (I stayed in two different ones over 3 stays) were quirky and interesting (karaoke room anyone?!) but overall very comfortable. The maids were always on hand if you needed anything during the day and were friendly and approachable.I ate in the cafe downstairs for breakfast and dinner a few times and the food was pretty good. Not a massive range but enough to satisfy all but the most picky. The breakfasts in particular are good ranging from pancakes with fruit to a full cooked breakfast as well as the option of a cup of breakfast tea, which for the Scottish traveller is a must. The bar of the hotel is pretty good too, well stocked and home to Friday and Saturday night Karaoke, which might not be to everyone's tastes but we enjoyed it (though didn't actually partake).The staff are truly wonderful. From Alex the manager, to Rob, Ricardo and Brendan on the reception desk, as well as Abbie in the cafe as well as everyone else who's names I didn't get or catch. They've certainly made our trip much easier than it would have been staying in a chain hotel or somewhere downtown. It's worth staying here, though it's a little further from the city. The neighbourhood is great with a lot of great bars and restaurants in the area.We'll all be back next year!\n\n\nRoom Tip: Check out the rooms online as each one is different, and ask for the one you want.\nSee more room tips"}

Definitely consider purchasing the 'express' tickets as we did. We only went for the single express (fast track) tickets (1 per ride) versus the multiple, and that was enough, as cost will then go up. You can still take as many rides on each attraction as you like but you'll have to que after using your 1 express option.2). Go to the rides you want to most take early/first and DONT use your express, save these for later.3). Food in Universal itself looked pretty average and is VERY expensive for what it is. Instead eat outside of Universal in the wider Sentosa complex as there are good places like Toast Box where the food is good and MUCH more reasonable.4). Whilst we didn't, you can get your hand stamped to go outside of Universal itself during the day and then go back in and continue going on the attractions. This way you can eat in the wider Sentosa complex (as 3 above)5). The locker facilities are good at Universal, however it's a bit of a free for all so be sure to hold your ground!!. Most of the themed areas offer free locker services for a period of 45 mins, after which you are charged, however NOT all, for example The Lost World wanted to charge you so instead we walked back to Ancient Egypt's lockers (free) to lock our stuff away.6). Dependant upon age of children and their level of adrenaline, be sure to research in advance the rides you want to go on so you plot your day accordingly. Whilst your waiting for the park to open at 10am, there are maps available for you to plan your strategy.Not being much of a ride person I actually found it a really good day out and get and very well payed out and we all had a thoroughly enjoyable day, not leaving until 4:30pm."}

The staff were nice and helpful, only spoke to the concierge once but she was really helpful when I did. They also got back to me very quickly when I emailed prior to my visit and kept a package aside for me. The hotel is in a great location with some great little eateries around the area.

The location where the hotel is situated on Chaweng is without doubt the best in terms of beach and sea. Buri Rasa is a very traditional, boutique, hotel with just 33 rooms which makes it very intimate.The hotel itself has really well arranged rooms and is as good for couples as it is for families with children. We stayed in 'our room' again a family suite (room 31) which has a massive master bedroom and a living room which also doubles as the children's room (and still has room for a kitchenette and sofa!!) and 2 balconies facing out to the beach/sea.The major thing which differentiates this hotel from the numerous others in Samui is the staff. They are without doubt the most friendly, personable and attentive team you will ever meet from reception to bar/restaurant and beach teams.The food here is as good as anywhere we have eaten on Samui offering traditional Thai and European cuisine. When you arrive and check in be sure to take advantage of the guest incentive offer whereby for a certain amount of THB credit you put on your credit card, for food and drink, the hotel provides you with an additional amount. I put THB20,000 (circa GBP500.00) on my card to spend and was given another THB8,000 to spend whilst here. It makes life very easy whilst you stay at the hotel and they are able to give you an update of your daily spend and remaining balance. Whilst there are too many people to name in person, apologies for those I have missed, are: Toi, Arm, Chart, Oui, Tono, A, Nu, Bom, Ann, Timmy, Nice, Jook, Joy, Jay, Pang, Apple, Bang.Buri Rasa owners/management, you are blessed with absolutely amazing staff. Look after them and ensure you retain them as it is your staff who truly differentiate you from your competitor hotels.Our thanks to the extended Buri Rasa team for making our 2 week stay with you, yet again, so wonderful.Regards and best wishesThe Deal family"}

Personally I think that with the extended areas Jungle Club had built they should retain some area specifically for paying guests (not a criticism more an observation).The 'houses' rooms, which we stayed in, offer a little more upmarket accommodation to stay in than the 'huts' although these also looked good.Rooms were well presented with very comfortable bedding and bathroom areas. Whilst the rooms have fans there is no air con. This was OK for one night however if the weather were to be really hot and you were staying for a longer period it may be a consideration.Without doubt the most memorable part of our 2 week stay in Samui with spectacular views around The Island.The food and drink is very good and reasonably priced.Staff are OK, they could do with being a little more friendly/personable as perhaps not as sociable as people we have encountered elsewhere we have been in Samui.Must see place to visit as part of your stay in Samui."}

With resident peacocks, monitor lizards, mina birds and (if you are lucky) wild monkey's all add to the ambience. The swimming pool had an adult only area which was welcome but to be honest the pool area was never over bearing with sun loungers always available.Staying at the hotel as part business trip, part family holiday (2 teenagers and wife), the hotel was perfect to match both needs.Rooms: We booked 2 rooms with an internal connecting door. A single room for all 4 of us would have been a bit tight but this combination was ideal and gave the feel of an apartment with space. Hotel provided a nice touch on arrival of fresh fruit, box of small cakes and free drinks in the mini bar (no alcohol) until consumed in the room. This was delightfully noted. Breakfast offered a huge array of multi-national cuisine and great coffee/teas/fresh drinks. It can get a bit busy in the main restaurant however you can take breakfast in 2 other locations if you are looking for a quieter experience. For us as a family sitting on the outside terrace was perfect enjoying the view and watching the wildlife congregate in the hope of a free morsel. The hotel offers a free shuttle bus every 20 minutes to Vivo City shopping mall (on the mainland) which has all the shops and restaurants you would need plus the metro if you want to travel further. Transfer time is about 10 mins and runs until 11.30pm. 2 mins walk from the hotel you can catch the free sentosa bus service to take you around the island, or the cable car if you want to sedately travel over the treetops. There is also a 24/7 convenience shop (Seven/11) to grab any essentials.The hotel is a no smoking hotel however if you do smoke there are plenty of smoking areas to do so including one of the terrace bars.Finally the hotel runs a kids club which although we didn't use looked absolutely fantastic.\n\n\nRoom Tip: The rooms facing the beach or the pool.

The front staff were courteous and informal which I liked. I had booked a double room and on entering all looked clean and tidy and well kept. TV was a little dated but hey it worked fine. What more can I say, all was good. Having arrived quite late, I wondered outside to find a quick bite to eat and literally within 2 mins walk there was a host of takeaways, restaurants and bars etc and in a nice area - another tick in my box - good location (+ 5 mins drive from University/Hospital etc).I slept well. You do hear people walking in the corridor but it wasn't a big issue.Breakfast in the morning was hearty and good quality.Late checkout - 11am was a real bonus especially as I didnt need to be anywhere until 11.30am, I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but right at the last hurdle, I thought I would take a shower before leaving - aha - it was really poor - no pressure and I couldnt get hot water - such a shame. Too late to complain but left the hotel on a poor note !!Having stayed at many hotels, I am always amazed that many never consider one of the vital important parts of a good stay is a good shower. Luckily the price I paid helped me give a rating of 4 stars but otherwise it could have been lower.I would definitely recommend the Highfield and would stay again but would just check the shower when I got there first and not last.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Check the shower works !!\nSee more room tips"}

But we did not get anything except for champagne offer which I declined. Instead, the lady at the reception struggled to retrieve our booking which was done thru expedia and finally we got the room keys after about 30 minutes. As the name suggests, the hotel has a casino and many restaurants. Apart from that, the hotel has pool and small shopping arcade which has Starbucks. The free car parking is in the adjacent building and it is quite a walk to the hotel lobby. The room was on 28th floor and was strip view. However, due to the show advertisement on the glass, the view from our room was not clear rather obscured. The room was of reasonable size and had all amenities (no coffee maker) in it. The bathroom was also good. The location of the hotel is very good as on the opposite side there is venetian, wynn, encore etc. Also it is close to Ceaser, Ballgio, and other casino hotels.

I stayed in room 212 and when entering, the whole room smelt of stale cooking oil which I assume was from the kitchens below but tbh I was too tired to complain. When you consider parking is an extra Â£8/night aswell , I would look for a different hotel next time. Staff were pleasant enough but you felt they lacked motivation and enthusiasm and working there was not great - That's just the impression I felt.So yes I could have complained at the time, but the point is you should not have to in the first place and no one asked me how my stay was when I checked out in the morning so just left with a poor experience."}

Its best to describe it as a 5 star resort with 5 star facilities. do not get confused with it being a 5 star hotel where your every whim is waited on hand and foot. The Atlantis caters for the masses so expect long check-in times and indeed queues for the main restaurants if half board. Its a busy hotel. All the customer facing staff are extremely nice.With that said we stayed as a family 2 adults and 2 teenagers and to be honest it was one of the best family holidays we have had. The food was always excellent and the facilities including free entry to the water park were great. There are several buffet style restaurants covered in the half board package or for an extra Â£10/head you can try out the premium restaurants such as Gordon Ramsey's Bread Street.The reason it only gets 4 stars (more 3.5 stars) is down to some basics. You will rue the day if you have an issue (even small) as the hotel does not manage customer issues at all well. You can find yourself spending many a frustrating hour resolving simple things like a faulty TV and longer if you have something a big bigger issue. Don't encounter an issue and you will be giving the Atlantis 5+. The day to day customer facing staff we met were all fantastic and lovely people - the hotel has that part nailed however they seem extremely limited in actual responsibility.Something to keep in mind - extras activities are not cheap such as water sports, dolphin encounter, 1/2 hour scuba dive etc - check out the prices on the website before you go so you do not get a shock. Also expect to pay Â£4 for a bottle of water in the buffet restaurants and Â£8 for bottle of water in the premium restaurants.Top Tips:If you can afford it go for the Imperial Club upgrade. We did and so glad - express VIP check-in/out, restaurant table reservations (straight to front of queue - no waiting), Imperial Club lounge: Breakfast, Afternoon drinks/canapes, all day nibbles/drinks and evening (alcohol) drinks/cocktails/food (5pm - 7pm) all away from the madding crowd. Nightclub free entry, free kids club and express entry to water park plus much more. The value for money comes more in the hassle free/queue free freedom and extra luxury it provides and not necessarily the cost saving. With that said we certainly got our monies worth in the drinks/cocktails/beers. Try the Shore restaurant next to the pool at night time for meal - food was best in hotel (mexican) and no extra premium for half board. In August though it is just uncomfortably hot eating outside. Dont forget to go to Duty Free as you leave arrivals at the airport or bring it with you. You can not buy alcohol in shops in UAE and can only buy drinks in hotels which by default are not cheap Â£8+/pint, bottle of wine Â£50+. You are allowed to buy 4 litres from Duty Free each (doesnt matter what it is Wine, Vodka, Whiskey) approx Â£10/each or 24 cans of lager approx Â£20. Always nice to have something for the room.Taxis in Dubai are cheap - 30 mins to Shopping Mall (Emirates) will cost you Â£7 each way although expect most taxi drivers to want you to round it up to Â£8 - Â£10 by saying how wonderful you are or they are short of change. See the water fountain display at night next to the Burg Khalifa, glimpse the Gold Souk just for the wow factor but expect to be pestered if you go window shopping and if its your thing go check out Souk Medina for ambience and Dubai version of Venice with fab restaurants/bars and posh trinket shops. Finally if for some strange reason you are staying at the Atlantis without children or yours are 18+ go to the Barista Bar next to Westin Hotel near the marina if you want to see the rich and famous or just have a drink/soak up the ambience in this World famous voted No 1 bar. Been a few times before but not this time as was with the family.\n\n\nRoom Tip: If you can afford it - go for Imperial Suite and above\nSee more room tips"}

You could quite easily go on holiday here no matter what the weather - its an indoor/outdoor water/spa oasis. Everything from fantastic kids slide area, huge wave pool, pools with a bar (nothing like apint whilst swimming), outdoor heated pools, selection of lots of restaurants, sauna's, steam rooms, health pools/treatments, ,adult only areas even a smoking area outside if you so wish. The quality of the changing rooms could be on par with a good hotel and even down to green lights in the parking area telling where a space if free to park your car. Another refreshing point for someone from England was the place was really safe with appropriate life guards etc but without any namby/pamby health and safety rules where they weren't needed such as the slide area - this meant even though the place was full there was no real queues - they just expect people to be intelligent.We went a few times to Therme Erding as part of our stay in Germany. You could quite easily stay all day - find a spot in the palm tree area and let everyone do their own thing. With that said although lots of sun loungers/seating areas, you might find it hard to find a spot but even then they had an seating\\sun lounge area which you could not reserve (ie OK to sit there but if you moved elsewhere you had to take your stuff (towels etc).Therme Erding operates a cashless system where you scan id wrist tag you are given on entering then they scan when you leave and tell you how much you owe etc. Be careful food/drink prices are a bit higher than normal (think train/service station prices) but you can bring your own food/drink with you. We paid 21 euro's (Â£16) each for 4 hours. Normal price is 24 Euros (4 Hours) or 31 Euros for the day.It may seem a bit steep until you actually go there and then you will realise what a great price this actually is. As we had teenagers we didnt make the adult only areas.The place is open to 11pm which is fantastic - we did go one day and the queue to get in was quite big (they only let a set amount of people in at one time) - no problem we just came back at 5pm One of the best if not the best water parks (Therme) experiences you can have - Forget Centre Parks in UK - catch a cheap flight to Munich, stay in Erding itself, which is absolutely lovely and go to Therme Erding - it will be half the price and twice/three times better."}

There are stairs which will take you to further on the top and view from there is heavenly. I really didn't want to come back from there. So beautiful.

It was like a home from home with complete kitchen diner, reception area, large bathroom/wetroom and great balcony. The quality of the accommodation was very good and due to staying over the Christmas period an excellent price. If I could find a niggle, the kitchen lacked a couple of utensils such as a can opener and maybe potato smasher but I am sure if we asked it would have been provided. Similar as we were staying for 10 days it would have been nice to have a brush at hand as apartment was tiled (lovely underfloor heating mind you), but with 2 teenagers floors can easily get muddy/dirty etc. We did get cleaners midway through our stay but nothing special only really swept and mopped floor, cleaned bathroom - been nice to change beds sheets etc but then again it wasnt a great issue. You do get access to washing machine but not in the apartment itself (as we thought) - you need to ask reception to arrange. All in all, we were pleased with our stay and very grateful to Matthias on reception who spoke excellent English and very nice/helpful.Hotel Linner is very close to Erding town centre which is absolutely lovely, picturesque and only 5 minutes walk. Similar you are only 5 minutes from a multitude of 'out of town' retail shops/supermarkets/KFC etc. We hired a car to get around sighseeing however one of the reasons to go to Erding was Therme Erding which was out of this World. You can buy tickets from Hotel reception which also give you 10% discount. The Therme is approx 5 -10 mins drive (30 - 40mins walk. Munich airport is literally 10 -15 mins drive from Erding.I would definitely recommend Hotel Pension Linner and indeed booking out one of their apartments which are great for families and beats a hotel room any day. Erding is a lovely town with lovely people and the Therme is just the icing on the cake. If you want to get away and do something totally different during Christmas period, you cant beat Erding or Hotel Pension Linner.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Book one of the attached hotel apartments - we found it through HomeAway and not on hotel website.\nSee more room tips"}

Lacked some small things like a wardrobe in main bedroom and outside light for patio area at night time. Would be nice to have WiFi too as this is key requirement these days especially with young boys, but we bought 5GB data sim from Vodafone Portugal (shop underneath supermarket) for 21 Euros (Â£15) and shared via hotspot on phone - lasted for our stay. Reception has WiFi but only for guests using their own resort apartments not private owned ones like this.Sandra who runs the apartment was extremely helpful and lives in the complex so any issues she sorts straight way. She also very good in all her communications. We also had a cleaner come to change bedding etc half way through our 12 day stay.Orada complex has one of the largest swimming pool areas I have ever seen and was great for the kids. Pool cleaned ever day and not a big issue to get a sun bed (ie you dont have to be up at 8am) although you may struggle if pool is busy however you can lay out on the grass surroundings. Pool has slight issue with the small mosaic tiles that are coming away in lots of places. This is more aesthetic than anything and not dangerous. They have fixed baby pool but seems only answer will be for management to completely empty pool in off season and fix properly. All in all the complex was really nice, with great layout, pool bar/restaurant (open to 10pm) , well tended gardens and clean and tidy.Location is next to marina (across the road) which has a good selection of bars/restaurants and of course its where all the boat trips go from. It fairly quiet at night but if you want a relaxing meal/drink its perfect. With that said you are only 15 min walk to the edge of old town Albufeira and main beach and then another 10 mins to the main centre. There is a fairly steep hill to walk up on the way in. Taxi are around 6-7 euro's each way.There are bus stops just outside the Orada complex for all the main water and theme parks. You will get a better deal on prices if you go to estate agent on main road instead of complex reception - we saved around 30 euros.Finally as its self catering, the local shops have the basic essentials but are more expensive (as expected) than the main supermarkets. Taxi to the large Continente or Aldi in town is around 7 euros each way (5 - 10 min drive). Surprised how cheap supermarkets were especially with a drinkable bottle of wine around 2 euro's."}

Location is lovely and nearest hotel to the ski slopes (although still 20+ mins on the bus) however nothing else near by (excluding activites) It is Â£6 by taxi to Aviemore centre or a nice 30 min walk - You can cut through the lodges and forest at the back of the hotel if walking.The hotel is very much family orientated and has lots of in-house activities such as a swimming pool, games room, separate kids indoor fun centre (crazy golf, big play zone etc), tennis courts, outdoor play area etc. Although good, you can tell it is due a refurb.We only stayed one night in the hotel as we had booked into the Hilton Lodges on site for the next 4 days after (we couldn't get in 1st night). We had a family double room (2 adults, 2 Children) which simply put, was a normal hotel double room they had managed to squeeze another double bed in so it was a bit tight, but as it was for only one night it was fine. I might have felt differently if it was for longer.We ate in the restaurant at night (Inverdurie restaurant) and the food was really good quality. The same went for breakfast the next morning.As we came to Aviemore for skiing, the onsite ski school and hire shop (run by SOS) was really handy and actually the cheapest and largest in whole of Aviemore. The Woodshed bar above was the nicest in the complex but no children after 8pm which is actually a good thing. The hotel has other areas where kids are allowed and adults can drink. So why only 3 stars ??Its small things that can easily knock your opinion - hotel is looking a bit tired in places, We understood the stupid Hilton policy about paying for childrens meals (age 11+) before arriving (if adults are on D/BB) but the restaurant staff still managed to confuse us totally and ruined a great meal when paying the bill. I understood the issue but how it was communicated was poor and the response was indifferent and lacked good customer service. Some small little shocks like Â£9 for a glass of wine and in-house Costa Coffee charging Â£4+ for a latte didnt help.To sum up the hotel could so easily get a 4 -5* trip advisor rating if customer service was not let down by a minority of staff, hotel had a general refurb and Hilton removed its silly child food policy (nice idea but doesnt work) and its little price shockers. I can compare it to how Ryanair used to be before they started losing customers and realised being open, upfront, clear on simple pricing and being reasonable actually does pay.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Rent yourself a Hilton Lodge based in the grounds instead of staying the hotel\nSee more room tips"}

Hotel is in a great location next to the beach and next to good nightlife that caters for all audiences. Very impressed with hotel and its staff who were always helpful. The hotel is well maintained and our apartment cleaned every other day. As we have 2 children the pool area was a key factor for choosing the hotel and we were not disappointed with its slides, restaurant and general layout. The hotel is also next to a very nice beach which is very handy. We also tried out the hotel's indoor pool and spa centre which was very good.On arrival which was late, we were not 100% happy with the room we were given however this was quickly resolved in the morning without any fuss and indeed a porter moved all our baggage for us whilst we lounged by the pool which was a nice touch.Recommend making a trip to the old town which is about a 25 min walk from the hotel. Maybe want to get a taxi back as it uphill on the return. Taxi's were really cheap at around 5 euros. Also recommend getting yourself down to the marina for a boat trip. We paid 39 Euro for Adult and 18 Euro for children for 6 hour BBQ boat trip, which considering all food and drinks included seemed a good deal. All in all, I would highly recommend Oura View Beach Club Hotel and its excellent customer service !!\n\n\nRoom Tip: 6th Floor is level with exit to main resort (shops, restaurant, bars etc) so very convenient.\nSee more room tips"}

I was a bit confused over recent feedback left on tripadvisor as I was sure they must be talking about a different hotel.Food - Excellent: 8 different main hot dishes each night (changes daily), not including the chef who cooked fresh fish and meat on the griddle. Not being vegetarian, I can not comment on the finer points but a whole buffet section was full of numerous salads (although some did contain meat). We loved the desserts !!! Breakfast were great too !!Facilities: 2 excellent indoor Spa pools, 2 large outdoor pools (one adult only on roof). Kids water play area, kids play area and club. Standard of Hotel and Rooms are modern and of high quality. In the basement there was a fully equipped Gym and Massage/Beauty Treatment. On the hotel roof were also 2 Tennis courts. Entertainment: There was lots of organised events during the day for adults and children alike (archery, shooting, water polo, darts, football, drawing 0etc etc) . What I like mind you was that none of it was in your face. I cannot stand being pressurised into something when all I want is to read a book by the pool. If you don't find out whats going on you may think nothing is happening. Night-time entertainment: The nightly hotel singing duo were not great, but they were only there for some soft simple background music, not as a main event. However each night around 9:30 -10pm the hotel laid on different acts, some were fantastic and some awful (especially 1984 UK New Faces contest winner - boy has he gone down hill - painful).Having spoken to various other people staying at different hotels, the Deloix Aqua is 5 star !!. For the people who said there were lots of Spanish, well I don't want to shock, but you are in Spain. Its a bit like saying you went on holiday to Devon and were amazed how many Brits were there !!! We met some really nice people both English and Spanish !!!To sum up, I highly recomment this hotel. Indeed I met a family who had been coming to Benidorm for years but first time to the Deloix Aqua. They asked what was up as the the pool wasnt packed and they could get a sun lounger and it was already 10.30am !!!"}

Since the overwater villa wasnât available for all the days of our trip, we stayed in a beach villa for two days! We liked both the rooms, though the overwater one was much preferred. The rooms were clean, well-maintained twice a day, and spacious.. The beds were comfy too! =) The beach villa, room no. 7, was at a perfect location that was very private, had palm trees on its left and right shielding us from the sun and from other villas, had its own beach front and waters a few steps from our villa. The only thing about beach villa, esp. being so well surrounded by trees, are the mosquitoes who are always hungry and awake. You just gotta be prepared with insect repellents. The overwater villa had no such problem, so we could rest or sleep on the suntanning beds without any mossie attack. We had room 37, which was really private and had a view of the sunset. My hubby snorkeled with the snorkeling team from the beach to the sea and right back to our overwater villa! We could hear the seaplane in the early morning, think it would be worse of the deluxe overwater villas which are nearer the jetty.We snorkeled from our beach villa right up to the breakwaters and nearby reefs, as well as from our water villa. The variety of fishes that we saw at overwater was much more than at beach villa. But we spotted many baby sharks near the beach villas but not at the overwater. Both had pros and cons. Overwater villa you could really swim with the fishes even at shallow waters, though the beach villa you gotta go nearer the reefs before you spot them. Despite me being quite a non-swimmer, the life vest kept me quite comfortably safe and you could snorkel at shallow waters and see lots of fish too. The breakwater at beach villa was a safety precaution though the waters before that was rather shallow and the sharp rocks made it hard to walk where it was too shallow to swim near beach villa no 7. Too many days of buffet was abit too much for us. The 8pm dinner was abit too late for me, as we had to take long walks after dinner to help in our digestion before sleep. =) We went on full board. But the food was good, by the two Italian chefs. Lotsa varieties of styles of cooking fish and seafood. Beef was nicely done up each time, even the turkey, pizza, etc. The Maldivian night where the Italian chefs were off, was not so good as much of the food was deep fried stuff with nothing really special. Some nice Indian curries =)The chamberboys, waiters, chefs, receptionist, diving centre staff were all helpful and friendly. Especially Daniel from the diving centre, who was really helpful, as this is my first time snorkeling. =) Those who showed us our room and to the seaplane could be more friendly though, afterall that it is the starting and ending point of our trip. Could have more activities, perhaps.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Overwater villas are surely worth a stay! We enjoyed the beach villa with our own beach front too! W...\nSee more room tips"}

I love the picture at the sanctuary where you see Jesus standing near his throne and many people around - some with their hands raised surrendering their lives, others holding a globe as intercessors; lifting a church unto the Lord etc. It speaks a lot about how christians live their lives unto the Lord. It's much less touristy in the front of the sanctuary where you can pray and do your devotion compared to Notra Dame where people go right in front to take photos.You can also take a walk at the Montmartre village around the corner.Magnificent view of paris from the hilltop where the church is. Just be careful of some black men who come up to you and tie some friendship band around your hand. A friend of mine whom i brought on my second visit was forced to give 20 euros by two of these men who did not let him go otherwise. You got to be fierce and avoid them before they get close. If you want to totally avoid them, take the funicular to the top- it is free if you have the weekly pass or 5 days pass."}

Oh and the aircon was not working well on the day we were there. The pool is 1.6m metres deep so children and the ones who cannot swim or shorter than 1.6m may wanna avoid if you have intention to use the pool.Not cheap but worth the money if you want a luxury holiday. One suggestion I have for Ayara is, please do not stop the hotel minibus to Patong Beach at the Christine Massage as it offers sleazy services, except if you want to portray your hotel as a cheap motel for people who are going for such services. If you are targetting families and couples of a higher class, then please consider changing the drop off and pick up point to Jungceylon or nearby. Was extremely disturbing as we didn't realise it until we went upstairs, intending to look for clean healthy massage venue. Was shocked that Ayara, which had impressed us all the way, would make this decision to stop their hotel patrons at Christine Massage! This is the one thing that almost spoilt my holiday.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Seaview is great! Get the seaview one if possible\nSee more room tips"}

Mind you, the waiting area is hot and humid, so waiting for such a long time is not worth the ride. More-over, if there are a total of about 30-35 rides, there must be equal retail outlets and double the amount of food counters. So effectively, one is paying for shopping and eating inside the USS.

The Inn provides basic toiletries but one can request for anything they want and we found the staff obliging us on most occasions. they serve a very decent breakfast and morning tea/ coffee in your room. There is a small swimming pool. The location also is fantastic as neither is it bang in the city centre and not is it far away, it is about 5 mins walk from the Palace.

First about the hotel room and amenities- excellent: Good sleep quality, well maintained rooms, abundant supply of toiletries and every room has a Pool view. Second criteria would be food- Very good: they have a resturant by the name Capre Diem which serves decent food and drinks (we had breakfast which had a good range). Third is the hotel overall- Good: the positive being the long pool and close to market location, the negative would be the area itself which is Legian. Legian is not a recommended beach in Bali (as per my experience), it isnt clean and is rough. Last pointer would be the staff and the service given which was excellent. The front office staff is helpful and room service delivers in shorter time than expected.Special mention of the staff- Dewa, Mini and others who extended their complete support when needed.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Try and book a pool access room. These get booked much in advance.\nSee more room tips"}

Please note that the hotel does not accept website booking with pay at hotel option. Our booking was confirmed by cleartrip (voucher issued) but at the hotel we came to know that our booking was cancelled by them and hence we could not stay there for the entire duration. The hotel, however, gave us one room for a night and this room was with an awesome view. If i remember, the room was 322, with a view of the snow capped mountain and the river. The rooms have gas heater and hence not dependent on power. In addition is the electric mattress which works very well. The hotel, however, needs to renovate their corridors and staircases. We are not sure if the hotel has lifts.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Room 322 with views on two sides. Pick river side view room.\nSee more room tips"}

To list a few disasters:1. The toilet flush doesn't work as there is no water pressure in the line. We called the hotel staff to help, their reaction was- \" Nothing much can be done, this is how it is in all rooms\".2. Linen was dirty and the second day of our stay, they didn't even change the smaller towels.3. To our surprise our cups and spoons were neatly kept after day one use, but they were actually never washed. One can imagine our surprise the next morning. We washed them but when we asked for paper napkins to wipe them, they were never delivered to us. Horrible service.4. The lounge on the terrace did not not have half of the things from the menu- there was no beer, no whiskey, limited food options. As this place is on out skirts of the city, there is not much option left to explore for dinner. Be aware of this fact.5. Breakfast was complimentary and so was the hair strand in the idli."}

To share an experience with all the readers- For dinner, there was waiting at the Sparsa, so we friends decided to try some other restaurant. Unfortunately, we picked up the worst hotel ever possible for dinner and came back to Sparsh at around 11 pm empty stomach.

On my request, the staff was willing to give us a room which had a tiny balcony, but it was too small for even anybody to pull a chair and sit, so we settled with a balcony-less front side room. Though I do appreciate the right approach shown by the Hotel Management. All in all a decent stay I would say!!\n\n\nRoom Tip: Other than the Suites, Grand Plaza has Elegance and Ambiance Rooms.

After a long queue to get in the fun immediately began. The amount of rides,shows and eateries is incredible. This place has grown so much in popularity that there are thousands of people meaning long waits for rides. Some rides are so good that they are definitely worth the wait. I'm not sure I'd wait 2 hours for a ride though. There is always the priority pass meaning you get to line up in a significantly shorter line so as to avoid long queues. Be aware that this doesn't apply to all rides. The food and drink is quite expensive in the grounds so you might want to bring your own in. A certain water 750ml water bottle sets you back 5 USD which is insane. The park is definitely well equipped and caters for the high demand of locals and tourists that visit this place on a daily basis. The frequency of the shows, the amount of shops and eateries means there is always something else to do. There's obviously something wrong if you manage to run out of things to do. Overall this is a great tourist attraction for everyone and the quality of everything they has on offer shows why there are large crowds everyday."}

With 4 first class seats, 48 business class seats, 28 premium economy seats and 184 economy class seats. As I was travelling in a group of 5 we sat at the back in economy class. It must be noted that the seating configuration is 3-3-3 which is significant in the fact that most major airlines have a 3-4-3 configuration. For economy travellers that always feel like they are being squished in an extra few inches really helps. However an odd number of seats in each row makes it slightly inconvenient for those travelling as a couple for instance. This was a day flight that left Auckland at 12:30pm and arrived at Singapkre around 19:00 in the evening. It was good to see that pillows and blankets are provided even though it is a day flight. By economy standards they were all right. Lucky for us we had a newly refurbished 4 class 777-300ER which includes the new economy product and WIFI. For someone that intended to use the WIFi I was slightly disappointed. I had searched up the price before leaving and it seemed genuine for in-flight WIFI. Unfortunately when I tried logging in there was no option for unlimited data caps. In the end I payed about 20USD for 50MB which is absolutely ridiculous. The new economy product was good as the seats didn't feel like they had been there forever. The added improvements is that the handset and the television screen are touch screen. However the biggest disappointment of the entire experience was easily the earphone situation. When boarding on the air bridge they hand out the cheapest looking earphones imaginable. The sort of ones that are liable to falling out at any moment and only have sound in one ear. Add plane noise at the back of the plane and watching a TV show or a film is not the enjoying,relaxing experience you would intend it to be. Subtitles might be a good idea but for me I watched one film and that was it. The earphone ruined the entertainment system in my opinion and will be most definitely be bringing my own ones next time I fly Singapore economy. On to the actual details of the flight. The pushback was fairly quick and the seatbelt sign was turned off only 5 minutes after take-off which is always good as some airlines take forever to turn the seatbelt sign off even when there's no turbulence. The flight attendants immediately got ready for the drink service prior to lunch. I always bring my own drink bottle to start off with and would recommend this to everyone as hydration is essential with the cabin pressure. To avoid waiting ages for the food cart to come around I ordered a special meal online a few days prior so I could have a meal a little bit earlier than everyone else. I was quite pleased with myself for this as my meal looked nicer than both of the standard options. I was served lunch less than an hour after take off whilst a lot of passengers had to wait around 90 minutes. Eating earlier is convenient as you can use the lavatory while everyone else is eating and you miss the bathroom rush when everyone else is finished. The toilet was pretty good for economy standards since I've seen the bathrooms in business class as well and they are quite comparable. The size is roughly the same depending on which toilet you chose as some were larger than others. The economy toilets has basic amenities such as mouthwash,flannels and travel toothbrushes. Business class has this plus a few more things such as combs and shaving sticks. At this point there was still around 8hours left and decided to watch a film. I must say for all the hype and good film selection I've had on previous flights this was a bit of a let down. They have to realise there are people like me who would rather enjoy watching classic films rather than the garbage Hollywood make these days. Later on after this I watched a documentary and then had a nap. I may not have fallen asleep as it was daytime however it was still comfortable. The lights in the cabin were left on all flight as it was a day flight. There was a decent selection of snacks in the galley which I made good use of. The flight attendants were constantly walking around with cups of juice and water which is something more airlines should do as it saves passengers pressing the service button constantly. Later on in the flight I did use the wifi which for airplane WIFI was decent speed but the prices were outrageous and my WIFI allowance didn't last that long. Several hours prior to landing there was a light dinner service. It was the same process for me as it was for lunch which was convenient. Once again I really enjoyed my meal and it looked better than the two standard options. Just before descent they handed out immigration cards. We landed on time and as always there is always a long taxi at Changi but we eventually got to our gate at Terminal 2.Overall this was a very enjoyable flight seeing as most people can't stand a long haul flight in economy. I would definitely fly this product again but would definitely bring my own headphones otherwise everyone else was substantial.Personal tipsBring amentities like lip balm,face and hand creamBring your own water bottle as Stewards can fill them upBring your own water bottles.With these three things economy can be a very good experience.\n\n\nTravel Tip: Bring your own headphones as the earphones provided are inadequate\nSee more travel tips"}

All three experiences were very similar from the menu to the service. Lucky for us there was always a table for 11 when we booked only a few hours in advance. This restaurant is located in of the main streets of Seminyak surrounded by plenty more restaurants and shops. There was a substantial selection on starter,main and dessert menus and there was also a good variety in cuisine. For example you could local cuisine as well as American and Italian. This gives everyone more option and kept everyone happy. Apart from drinks perhaps we never had to wait to long for our order to arrive bearing in mind we were a party of 11 which is not always easy for a restaurant to handle. Each occasion we visited the restaurant was full but well staffed ensuring an efficient operation throughout our visit. Even though the restaurant is on ground floor the toilets are found upstairs. For those interested the restaurant has free wifi. This was a middle of the road restaurant as best I could tell but the prices will portably still seem quite cheap to most foreign visitors. There course meal for 11 people was around 160USD. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone who visits Seminyak and will hopefully return one day in the future."}

No one in our group had any complaints about their food or drink all night which goes to show how good this restaurant. The variety of cuisines made sure there was something for everyone on the menu. AFor the area this is one of the more expensive restaurants however most foreigners who visit Bali will find the prices pretty reasonable.

A friendly driver was already waiting for our family as soon as we had arrived and I sensed that we were in for a treat. The one thing a lot of people need during and straight after flying is water and luckily for us they were waiting at our seat in the airport transfer van. You can't blame the driver for the long drive but for Bali traffic standards the 45min drive wasn't to bad seeing as we had no place to be in a hurry as it was already about 8pm at this time. Once we had arrived the porter was already waiting to greet us and take our bags to our villa. We went to reception and received a warm welcome from the staff and to our relief a cold drink and cold towel which is the sort of first impression that some other places lack. The check in process was fairly straight forward and we were led to our villa which fortunately was the closest one to the reception. The villa is sold as a four bedroom deluxe villa which is certainly was as their was just about everything we needed within the villa. The villa is around 400 Square metres which included a pool,garden and four near identical twin rooms all with a connecting bathroom. Even though it was night time a dip in the pool was very refreshing after flying and the pool continued to serve its cool and refreshing purpose throughout our weeks stay. The villa had a fully equipped kitchen and plenty of seating. A water cooler was definitely well utilised, with this being a key feature to western people in a tropical country. An extensive room service menu was well received within my travelling group so we utilised this multiple times so didn't really use the cooking facilities on offer. Each individual room had a king bed, a TV, an air conditioning unit and a desk. So basically everything you would find in a typical hotel room. The room size being roughly 16 square metres with the connecting bathroom being a similar size. The bathroom consisted of a separate shower and bath. The Mutiara had their own branded amenities which weren't very good so I would recommend bringing your own. However they did provide things such as combs and cotton buds so the bathroom was well equipped. Also in the bathroom area was a large sized wardrobe which had things such as an umbrella and jandals and of course plenty of coat hangers and space to store your clothing. One thing that you would find in most hotels but not here is an iron which was a bit unfortunate. The villa did offer a reasonably priced laundry service which we utilised several times. Included in our rate was breakfast and afternoon tea. You could order these meals to your room or have it in the communal dining area. The breakfast was a la carte with plenty of western and local dishes to choose which should satisfy most travellers. All the food regardless of what meal was always delicious and we never found ourselves waiting to long either. The most disappointing aspect was the gym which would easily be the worst I've ever seen. Almost squeezed into a small corner room by the communal pool the gym consisted of very minimal equipment which was all outdated and some machines didn't even work. This is one thing that villa could refurbish as the rest of the complex looked fairly modern. I guess a lot of travellers who come here intend on having a relaxing trip so this probably won't bother many guests. One of the best things I liked was how private the villa felt. With high walls surrounding your villa you could easily have mistaken the villa as a private home. Even walking around the grounds the place felt very secluded and the communal pool was usually deserted when I walked past. The hospitality was your typically world class service that Indonesia is known for. Everyone that we interacted was always very friendly and quick to accomodate our needs. The attentiveness of all the staff leaves a good lasting impression. The wifi was free but would often be frustratingly slow which could annoy those who need to work, however we were on a relaxing trip so this didn't bother us much. Overall this is a very nice place to stay for a week. Apart from minor things such as slow wifi, no iron and an outdated gym the villa experience was exceptional and would definitely stay again if I ever had the chance to.\n\n\nRoom Tip: If you want a pool\nBook a villa and not a standard room\nSee more room tips"}

The room layout and design of the lobby are rather familiar as I've stayed at holiday inns across the world. We had booked 2 standard rooms and checked in at about 9pm. Whilst checking in we realised they had arranged us smoking rooms when we had requested non-smoking rooms. They said they will try fix this so we sat down for a drink in the lobby while this was happening. About 20 Minutes later they said they had arranged non-smoking rooms for us. My sharp eye could see that they were the original room numbers and we asked if they were indeed non-smoking rooms. The check-in operator said they were non-smoking but I wasn't entirely convinced. When we got up to our rooms the moment we opened the door the smell of smoke was pretty obvious. The housekeeper was trying to convince us it was a non-smoking room as there was no ash tray. Nice try. As was our luck the hotel was fully booked for the night and we couldn't change rooms till later in our stay. Further more the lady operating the check in counter the next morning agreed with the fact that they were smoking rooms. Common courtesy is when your requested room is fully booked is to upgrade you not downgrade and lie about it. Sort it out Holiday Inn. Moving on from this saga the rooms would have to be on the small side although they still had all the amenities a holiday inn would usually have so at least this didn't disappoint. There wasn't really much of a view either. The coolest feature of this hotel is the rooftop pool and gym. The facilities up here were great and look to be well used by all the hotel guests. A hard working pool attendant that always made sure everything was in order made the experience even better. The housekeepers and check in staff could certainly learn a thing or two from this gentleman. There was a buffet breakfast served daily which had a good variety of local and western dishes so there was always plenty of options for most travellers. The service in the breakfast room was great. Overall it was a pretty standard holiday inn experience for me. With the great amount of hotels and the price we paid I think I will be staying somewhere different next time in Singapore.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Some rooms are designated smoking rooms.\nNon-smokers should avoid booking these at all costs.\nSee more room tips"}

There was a good variety of meat,seafood and vegetarian dishes so there was a dish for everyone on the menu. Often the case is that you make a reservation and end up waiting for your table to be ready, so don't turn up expecting to be seated straightaway when the restaurant is busy. I can't imagine this being the case for weeknights though. However once we were seated we were served immediately which is always good when you've been waiting for your table for some time. Throughout the evening the service was fairly efficient and the restaurant was well staffed. We didn't try any of the desserts but I'm sure they would have been just as high quality. For the quality of meat/seafood you get the prices are alright but not the sort of pace for those dining on the cheap. I would definitely recommend visiting again and the restaurant is suitable for all ages including young families."}

In terms of the room we were probably unlucky to get the corner room as the room was poorly designed due the fact it was the corner room. There wasn't a lot of walking space once the sofa was folded out into a bed for two. The air conditioning wasn't great and the pillows made for an uncomfortable sleep. The design of the bathroom was also questionable with the room steaming within moments and the drainage system not being that great. However we were kindly given more towels upon request. The toiletries were satisfactory for a motel. The bedrooms were on the small side and one room had no storage rack or wardrobe which I find very inconvenient. There was a fully equipped kitchen which was useful although we were only there overnight. Overall the motel served its purpose by being close the cycle trail otherwise I wouldn't be in a rush to stay back here if I'm ever in the region again.

Reserved a large table only several hours prior on a Sunday evening. We were seated right away and instantly had menus in front of us. This is one of many places in Singapore where you use an order form to order your meal. This is a great idea as you can therefore order when your ready and not when the waiter/waitress is ready. The menu was impressive in particular the wide variety of drinks on offer. The selection of Asian based dishes was also notable. Once the order form was handed in the dishes came out within 10 minutes which is very fast. This may not be the case when the restaurant is full but lucky for us the restaurant was only half full. Overall I definetly would recommend this restaurant for any sort of occasion and it is suitable for families and there is food for everyone."}

This restaurant is located in downtown Auckland in the same building as many other restaurants. So if you are looking for a quiet,peaceful dinner this is definitely not suitable. We were seated immediately having made a reservation in advance and served straightaway. I would say the restaurant was half-full and their was an adequate amount of staff. The menu consisted of traditional Mexican food and drinks such as tacos and margaritas. The two courses took roughly 90mins and was a great experience the duration of our visit. The food was of high quality but I'm not sure the prices represented the size of some of the portions but it all tasted delicious which is important. Throughout the evening the service was a bit patchy and you got the feeling some of the staff were new to the industry as we would often see waiter etiquette not being adhered to. Can't really complain because we didn't have to wait to long and the food satisfied my expectations. Overall I would definelty recommend it to anyone wanting quality Mexican food and anyone who wants to experience a good atmosphere."}

Location - can't get better than this at this price in Sentosa! Just across IMBIAH and sentosa melion... easy to go anywhere on the island with monorail and cable car just a walk away.

No Welcome, straight simple checkin process... Lobby - can hardly be called a Lobby - a big disappointment, made me wonder if actual reception was somewhere else. Now if there are guests landing everyday in morning after a long flight and you do not have room available till 3pm, must have a decent resting place (they have wooden benches) and a decent place to freshen up. The good part - people were knowledgeable and immediately helped plan the full day (maybe they get guests like this everyday).Was told that they will call as soon as room was available, but call never came. Room was ready when we came back with luggage sent in already3. The Room - Disappointment, made us check if indeed this was the room which was booked and by mistake we have been offered another room. Images do not compare with the actual room. Size is okay, layout was not. After opening up the Sofa bed, hardly any place to move... one had to move through the bathroom. It was Heritage suite, can't say what was Heritage about it. No place to oput all the luggage in!!4. An empty place - hardly saw anyone in the hotel, maybe everyone was out in Sentosa.5. Servicing was another disappointment, after the first call, had to start thinking about asking for additional bottles of water. 2 Adults and 2 Kids with just 2 500ml bottles placed!! Saw very few smiles, team was more straight faced than welcoming6. Comfortable bed, no view to talk about from the window... Seems it was a corridor which has been covered to make it a room!!7. Checkout was quick, there was hold put at the time of checkin, after 10 days i am still waiting for a refund.Disappointed as it is Le Meridien... expected much better.."}

There is the option of sitting outside on the wharf on a good day otherwise most of the seating is inside. At the time we visited we could order from either the breakfast or lunch which gives you more choice of course. The one thing that stuck out to me was the service. Instead of your drink coming soon after ordering it came at the same time as the meal which is unusual,but no complaints as both food and drink were excellent. Overall the menu is not that extensive but there is enough variety to find something you will like at a reasonable price. Overall I think the location is great and the food is satisfying so I would definitely recommend going."}

The seats aren't that wide for business class seeing as the economy configuration is 2/3/2 but at least there is no middle seat in business class. There are only 4 rows so the cabin feels quite small. The service was consistent throughout with the two flight attendants Kelly and Gabe doing a great job serving the 20 or so passengers. The service started prior to take off with a pre departure beverage of either juice,water or wine. After a short taxi the plane took off with the seat belt sign turned off about 10 minutes later and the meal service beginning shortly afterwards. To start there was drinks and nuts and two options for starters and then the mains there were three options accompanied with bread and dessert there were also three options. The meal service took a bit over an hour and the food was excellent across the courses. Overall the meal was quite good and all someone would need for a short 3 hour flight. One of the best things about the seat was the amount of legroom each passenger got. I didn't have an aisle seat but could get up to go the lavatory without disturbing the passenger In the aisle seat. The lavatory was pretty comparable with economy lavatories unfortunately. Some of the great touches to the service included the water bottles each passenger received and the pillow and the blanket even though it was only a 3 hour flight. The entertainment didn't quite live up to my expectations as I have been on other airlines that have had a much more comprehensive movie and TV show selection. But I didn't even watch a movie on such a short flight so I wasn't really disappointed. We had a smooth landing and a short taxi and business class passengers were off pretty quickly. Overall this was a great experience and one of the more enjoyable flights I've had across the Tasman."}

The economy product has gone slightly backwards in recent years due to Emirates cost cutting. Anyway the seats,food and entertainment are pretty much the same. The seats are in a 3/4/3 configuration which is Normal for a A380. Emirates constantly rank high with their in flight entertainment and it didn't disappoint with a variety of old and new films and a lot of music,games and TV shows as well. Economy passengers still gets a meal on this short sector although the meal and drink service didn't start until after one hour into the flight which if you ask me is too long. But the food was satisfactory for economy which is important. Also since the whole floor is economy passengers can walk around the whole floor which is great for stretching the legs mid flight. The toilets were pretty standard and there were enough for the several hundred economy passengers aboard.Overall I think this is the best option for travelling between New Zealand and Australia as the prices are pretty comparable with other airlines for economy.\n\n\nTravel Tip: Check in early\nSee more travel tips"}

However once the food arrived we all enjoyed the meals and we all found they were quite fulling which is satisfying after waiting a while. Unfortunately some of my family members ordered milkshakes and were told 30 mins later that they had run out of ingredients. Thus meaning they were at the restaurant almost an hour before receiving a drink other than complimentary tap water. The sharing platters were very good and the prices were reasonable.

We stayed for 8 nights at the villa Kensington. On arrival we had previously requested an early check in as we arrived at 9am and had been on two long-haul flights but we're not given rooms till 2pm. I was first surprised at the small room but struggled to adjust going on previous hotels I have stayed in. The air conditioning was Not great and there were not even flannels/cloths in the bathroom for washing yourself. The room clearly needed refurbishing as there were marks and inadequate painting on the wall. For this area it was overall a disappointment. If you want to stay in South Kensington I would suggest somewhere else like the Holiday Inn. The lift was not great either it would bump 10-15 times before opening at your floor. So the stairs were a better option. The breakfast did not have a wide variety but I there was enough to be satisfied. overall I was disappointed and would not stay here again.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Ask for the biggest room available\nSee more room tips"}

Due to the busy holiday weekend they just had economy rooms available for $350 that night. No big deal as this was last minute on a holiday weekend. Being the room was economy it was like a normal Holiday Inn or Comfort Inn room, minus a mini fridge. Really..? So we had no way to keep drinks cold. Not sure what the economy rooms usually go for on a normal night, but put a $65 fridge in the room. A mini fridge is standard in almost all hotel rooms now so I definitely expected one in a $350/night room. Will we stay there again? Sure! Would I recommend it? Absolutely!

There are some great reviews that tell how to plan your day and I highly recommend it. The most impressive ride is the transformers however the line at 10:15am was 110 mins and didn't seem to abate all day until a storm came through and scared many people away. My recommendation is to do battle star gallactica rides first thing then go to mummy and jarrasic world ride when it opens at 11am. Finish off iurrasic world other rides then do waterworld show at 12. Next go to far far away and do all rides there and have lunch if you haven't already. Then go to Madagascar and main centre for shopping etc and at about 4-5 go see how transformers. If you have a express pass use it here!!!! Good luck."}

The draw on this is only 2 ft but the narrow spot only just fit the van and there was nowhere to park the car. These sites are best suited to the shorter vans or expander but the park should have known this when putting us in as we have them all our lengths etc. we couldn't move as we were staying until the Easter sat and they were fully booked. Don't get me wrong this is a fabulous park and the pools are Fantastic. The water park needs resurfacing as the rubber ground has come away but hopefully the new owners will sort this out. The check in staff are fantastic and take you on a tour of the whole grounds in the buggy. This is the first realisation of how far we were from any pool. The pools are all at the cabin end of the park. All the van sites are at least a 10 minute walk from them so you are cool but hot again by the time you get back to your van. We have Ac so left it on and were able to cool down at least. This is an expensive park but unlike some places you can see where your fees are going."}

We did everything except the hydro tour as our kids were a bit young( 9\u002611). The ground are fantastic. The waterfall is amazing and the van sites are spacious powered and the amenities brilliant. The ruins are just that. Floods cyclones and time has destroyed all beauty that was there and it is up to your imagination to see what was. The staff were friendly but there seemed to be an awful lot of them. Our tour guide was an American girl who was fairly new and had learnt the script but not the feeling behind it. The price is high but if you take advantage of the free camp night it's well worth it. The new owners have been bitten by the Paronella dream and it will be fascinating to see if they are able to fix the damage, fighting a crazy Queensland government that heritage lists it then stops all attempts to stop its decay and destruction. This is a must see whilst in the region as it will touch you and inspire you in many different ways."}

Everything was fantastic. The chicken nuggets were fresh strips of chicken not pre-processed. What a wonderful surprise. The prices were very reasonable but the food was fabulous.we came back the next night to the local village show which is 30 mins of interactive delight and ordered differently off the menu this time sharing between three the sweet and sour pork and the pasta with chicken and roast pumpkin.

We bought 4 standard tickets online for 4 adults (inc a 13 and 16yr old). Got there at 9.50. Park opens at 1000. Short queue at Guest Services to get tickets from the email barcode and then joined a long queue to get in. Queue moved quickly and we were in the park within 20minutes. Rides near the gates were very busy so we skipped ahead and found a 30 minute queue at Galactica. From then on we never queued anywhere for more than 45minutes. Left the bigger rides to the end of the day so only had a 20 minute queue at Transformers (it's amazing!) and NO queue at Galactica (again!!) - Cylon is the one to do!! Ate in the restaurants. Noodles were very nice as was chicken and rice. Both priced at about $12 and good portions (although we could have had them for $7 if I remembered the vouchers that came with our online tickets!!) By 8pm we had done all the main rides at least once and most if the smaller rides. Place is spotless, facilities excellent, staff very helpful and friendly. Some rides it pays to go as 'single riders' as these were very short queues used to fill odd seats. Keep an eye out for we're you can use this. I was beating some Express Pass holders onto rides this way. As for Express Passes. I wouldn't waste the money. It's an extre $100 and the benefits didn't seem that great on our visit, maybe at weekends it's busier? Regardless, it's a GREAT day out."}

Had to help the wife finish her pork as she couldn't manage it all. Again, very tender and tasty. Plates cleared again quickly. Left for about 20 minutes before we were offered dessert, which was fine as needed time for the mains to settle. After deliberation we skipped dessert and asked for bill. Few minutes wait and we were served the bill. Sharing platter starter, two mains, a side order and 3 pints came to Â£46. I don't call that excessive, especially for the high quality of the food provided. Left very happy and will definately be going again.

The new chocolate and raspberry sundae was out of this world. As it was new, the landlady was keen for our feedback and we had a great conversation with her. This is a real, old fashioned, traditional pub with some great ales and great food. Food is sourced daily and locally as far as possible - the steaks actually came from the farm we were staying on!! This showed in the quality of the food overall. Daily specials change frequently depending on what produce they source and added a nice extra selection to the regular menu. Well worth a reek off the beaten track to try. Very highly recommended. Not open Sunday evenings at the moment though. Thanks for some great meals Blacksmiths."}

Sun on the terrace from 9.30am until gone 7pm. Lovely Swiss restaurant nearby. Apparently the Bar at the entrance is lovely but we never got that far in the evenings !! As much to do as you want nearby (or as little as you want!) Cave systems, waterfalls, beaches, local towns with markets and fiestas, big shopping mall at Le Marinas or Mariner (?) We did a few bits but the weather was so good we just enjoyed the relaxing to the sound of the crickets and birds as we lay around the pool all day. We will definitely be going back !!

What amazes me most is the way they are able to handle that amount of people coming into the park. The place is well managed with friendly staff all over the place.An advice for those who are really into rides is the get an express ticket way before the day itself. The express tickets works on a very simple demand and supply curve. Hence booking earlier will get you a better price. I made a mistake and brought it that day itself as I wanted to observe the crowd first. Bad mistake, I ended up paying $70 per pax when I could have gotten at $50 ( express , per ride one time only) I heard if you book way much earlier, you could get it for $30 only. Do yourself justice, if you are coming from overseas. Don't save on the small things, get the express and enjoy your time there. There's simply so many things better to do than queuing. Have fun people!"}

Eurostar from Ashford was a breeze. Disney Express service gets your bags from the train to the hotel so you go straight to the park (\u0026 vice versa when you depart). Train is hot \u0026 crowded, very poor aircon, so take drinks. We used Hotel Cheyenne. Basic but clean and warm \u0026 staff very helpful. Ask for extra pillows straight away otherwise they run out. No tea or coffee facilities in room but kettle hire etc at Reception. Breakfast's a right bun fight if you get the times wrong. We ate everyday at 8.15. By 8.45 they were queuing (or not if your French) out the door. Good continental breakfast \u0026 masses of it. Been before so took freezer bags \u0026 made rolls at breakfast for lunchtime (otherwise paying 8 Euros for a 6 inch hotdog) Both parks are great. We got 9 inches of snow on the 2nd day so it was really magical. Quite a few things got closed for safety \u0026 following days staff had difficulty getting in so some attractions stayed closed. It was bitterly cold throughout so take thermals \u0026 layers. Staff worked really hard to open what they could maiking sure indoor shows ran so visitors could get in out of the cold with kids. French don't (sorry, can't) queue so getting to see characters \u0026 keeping your place at some of the shows was a matter of determination and bony elbows - a rucksack on the back and lots of turning around seemed to work !! All the rides were great. Age doesn't matter, its Disney, we're all kids !! Suprised you can get onto the Tower of Terror at a height of 1.02m but you need to be 1.40 for Indiana Jones rollercoaster ? PS TofT is mental, my 6yr old was having kittens laughing and screaming at the same time ! We booked 3 \"events\" before we went. 1. Wild West Show. Great entertainment and a meal included. Would highly recommend this as kids had a ball shouting and whooping. 2. Princess character meal at Auberge de Cendrillion. Posh menu, average cooking, cafe level of service - and it wasn't that busy ! Kids meal total trash - dry burger, manky sloppy veg and what was meant to be mash potato (but wasn't ?) you could fit in an egg cup. Only a few characters too. Would NOT recommed this. You can get far better value for money elsewhere. Like .. 3. Character lunch at Golden Nugget. All you can eat buffet. Plenty for kids, pasts, chips, nuggets, chicken, salad. Really tasty selection for adults - Mexican, fish etc --- just great. Loads of characters, really friendly staff. Excellent value and kids loved it. (PS Wife says loads of great deserts too !!). Friend with us did Buzz and Woody lunch in Frontierland that was justa s good. Bus transfers between hotel and park take about 100 people and are every 12 minutes. Other than A de C can't say a bad word about the holiday. You can pay more and get a posh hotel but by the time we got back in the evening all the kids wanted to do was crash out. Room TV only has Disney Channel and 24hr news in English but does have scart sockets etc for portable DVD use (need batteries as mains socket a way away). Park prices are typical disney. In Euros expect to pay Coffee 2.5, hotdog 8, small popcorn 5, beer 6, 75cl coke 4. In a \"character venue\" meal 18-26, beer 6-9 a pint, OJ 4. No free water for kids only 1L bottles."}

Stayed in the queen deluxe. Well obviously with the price I paid I won't expect 5 star hotel features. However these are the facts why this hotel comes highly unrecommended despite the price and location.1) Somehow they are very firm on their hotel check in policy. 2pm means 2pm. Though the service staff mentioned that they were full last night, it's hard to ponder that not even a room is ready for a check in at 1230pm not 125pm. 2) They don't have a car park, it's shared by the same building which will cost a flat rate of 5RM. Do remember to take down your rental car number. What horrible about this car park is that it's serve by just ONE lift that goes up to the 16 floor. So happy waiting if your have just parked. I timed, my partner and myself waited 4 min for the lift to arrive.3) The wifi - don't even bother to log on4) The shower head of the bath room is one of the worst design I have ever experienced in all my stays worldwide. It's pointed at one angle and can't be shifted. Hence be prepared to wet the floors if you are showering. 5) The temperature of the aircon can't be adjusted. So just wear a jacket when you enter the room6) They only provide one room key, so make sure you travel with someone who doesn't sleep early, else you will be trapped in the room.7) Why bother providing a TV when the channels are limited and unclear. HmmmThough I would like to point out unlike some comments I read about rude staff, I beg to differ and felt they were all polite and very willing to help. These hotel is suitable for travelers who- don't drive- don't use wifi much- used to cool temperature- don't watch much tv- travel aloneHave a great holiday in KL, cheers!"}

Towels questionable too. What's weird about it is that they provide 3 pillows on a queen size bed instead of the standard 4.However the rooms are relatively spacious so for travelers with huge baggage, rest at ease. Reception was very friendly too, not as what was mentioned earlier by some travelers. Of course don't expect 5 star hotel treatment, but for me, from the front door Valvet to the reception, all were nice and friendly.TV lovers, pls bring your own iPad or laptop as the television provided is so tiny that you may want to stick your face at the screen.Those who want to use wifi, think of the good old days using dial up modem. It works better than here.Oh and big size people, you may not fit into the shower room, it's measured to standard Asian male size. You may fit in but may not come out. Other than that, no complains.As most reviews mention, it fits the purpose of a night stay near the airport. Don't try to stay more than a day, else you may need medication. And I am dead serious about it.Cheers and have a good stay."}

The only reason why any foreigners would stay there is for a specific purpose. Myself, to go to a nearby local doctor known for healing impossible. Orange hotel is usually the first choice but since it was fully booked, I tot I settled for this one.Upon arriving at night, the check in process was swift and easy. What caught my eye though is there were rates available for 2-3 hours. Also the air on and TV remotes were handled together with the room card. Failure to return these 3 items would result to a lost of your $50 ringgit deposit.The rooms were small and looked exactly what a quick stop motel would look like. The cleanliness was to expectation though. What was really bad about the hotel is the walls and doors are almost no barrier to sound. I was unlucky enough to have some inconsiderate or forgetful hotel guest in the other room that set their alarm at 5am and didn't turn it off. Yup!! So it was ringing for 5am onwards. Those people are probably there for the same reason as me, to see a nearby doctor. Anyway to summarize, the location of the hotel is ok, the rooms are clean and the price is worth it. First choice for me though would be Orange. Oh yes, and pray hard you don't meet forget or inconsiderate people that leave their alarm clocks on throughout."}

Initially was very excited to try their fried eggs, fish and prawn petai. When I arrive with my family, we decided to try more dishes and added in otak, fried kailan and salted egg chicken. As follows each dishesFried egg- read a review on oh wow the egg is , well, I guess the writer may have been too hungry and seldom have any fried egg thrown into hot boiling oil, the result: cooked instantly with slight crust at the sides. Totally normal and no WOW factor. 5/10 ( its eggs, if the chef can't do normal eggs, this place will be in trouble )Thai style fish , deep fried- Had no idea if it was fresh, but for sure it definitely tasted fishy despite the heavy taste of sambal on it. The sambal paste was pretty decent, however can't say the same about the fish. Hence overall a 3/10 for me Petai squid \u0026 prawn- probably shld rename the dish and replace prawn with shrimps. Yup, tats the size of the \"prawns\" as small as a fishing bait. The squid came out like little worms as well. The flavor of the dish is decent, but the content of the dish was horrible! 3/10 is already being very forgiving.Butter kailan- probably the best dish on the table. It was cooked to perfection and the taste was good. 8/10 easily for this dish Salted egg chicken - if the owners are reading this, Please rename it to thick coat flour dipped in salted egg york. Totally no taste or even had a feel of the chicken meat. What was put into my mouth was thick flour. UNRATEDOtak Otak- decent, edible , not out of the blue nor out of this world. Other than that, no comments. 6/10Total bill came to about $150 ringgit. Dishes were serve in small plates. Not recommended at all."}

If you are a morning person and planning to stay here, do continue to read on. After a awesome night stay in the room, we woke up to have breakfast at level 3. Imagine yourself in your morning most comfy clothing, shorts and singlet. I went over to inform my room number, mention 3 times, each time this staff repeating the wrong room with the wrong name, until I had to point it out myself. Well it wasn't over, I was told there is a dress code!! Sleeveless not allowed. ( what a start wasn't it ) ok, fine, instructed the front desk to sit my partner down and I will come back down again after I have changed. When I came down, the same staff brought me in and, you won't believe this!! Sat me at a different table when my better half was outside! Bad start to a day is all I can summarize. However , credit to the other staff who was quick to apologize and especially Mr Andhry Adhryanto who took the trouble to find me just to hear what happened.Ok aside with the horrid breakfast. The check in was efficient and the staff was very polite. Got into the room and shortly after the door bell rang. Fruits were delivered. Unfortunately, we had a noisy neighbor and so we decided if it was possible to switch room. Called up front desk, and again , totally appreciative to them, the room was changed effectively. A bell boy came up to hand over the new set of keys. Service sure was top class at this point, but wait, it gets better. After we got our new room, less than a minute later, the door bell rang again... guess what? Fruits delivered again!! Now if this isn't proper and effective communication between the staff, such co ordination could never happen. Truly awesome service.The rooms were clean and the amenities provided in the washroom was top class too. Room slippers were not those cheapskate ones, shower gel etc all looked to be carefully chosen.Overall stay even with the horrid breakfast experience is a perfect 10.One thing though, the pillows on the bed were too soft. If the management could put extra pillows in the cupboard, it would been perfect.Definitely a \"must come back stay\" hotel in Bandung."}

Well, that wasn't the most upsetting thing, what totally pissed me off was upon checking in, I was asked for my credit card for \"VERIFICATION'. The first thing that came to my mind was the usual checking the physical card against the one that was booked with. Hence, stupidly I gave and paper work was done to start the clock of my 15min wait when the receptionist ( I wont mention the name ) told me to sit around and I Will be informed when my room is ready. ( SERIOUSLY HILTON?? Do you think I am walking into a clinic to wait for a doctor?)Fine, I went out for a smoke, and my hp beep... \"there was a transaction of $300 on your AMEX card\" This totally made me upset and I went inside again to clarify. Probably the staff wasnt taught that VERIFICATION and HOTEL DEPOSIT and two very different meaning. The receptionist insisted it was for verification and started trying to teach my what the purpose of the \"VERIFICATION\" was, I simply had to shut the person up by saying the right word is HOTEL DEPOSIT! Which I could have given cash instead as well, which most hotels allow.Fine, since I was there for a holiday with my partner, I thought just let it rest. After waiting for the 15min, the staff came along and presented me the key etc, Fine.. that's great right? Noooooo... he presented to me as well the authorisation receipt and told me in case the bank charges you etc... ( Ok, I am not well travelled?? Did I look that way?? Do I need a lesson from you?? ) Anyway to the management of Hilton Malaysia, please teach your staff the difference between VERIFICATION and HOTEL DEPOSIT.. Its' a world of a difference.Apart from that, the rooms are clean, location of the hotel is strategic as most reviews would comment. As far as those upgrades, I sincerely doubt. After all since I had to wait for almost 15min for my room? Why wasnt there an upgrade? Though I will be here for another night, but I doubt I will be spending anymore time to write up stuff on this hotel for now."}

What I like about this place is the food ( of course) and the service ( very accommodating as I don't take broccoli and cauliflower , they changed it to garden salad for me )Today I ordered 3 dishes, lobster bisque, escargot and the NZ ribeye.Lobster Bisque- Taste is rich and potion is decent for $6. Surely no one is expecting real lobsters to be used for that price, probably the meat given is shellfish. (7/10)Escargot - Not for the weak heart! Presentation was awesome , looks yummy, they even lit up a fire in front of you.. Must be really good right? Wrong, the worst I have ever tasted. If they spent the amount of time preparing the dish rather than presenting it , the taste and texture would be better. Basic fundamentals of serving escargot was forgotten. It wasn't piping hot, it wasn't baked with the garlic ( the roasted garlic was served separate) there just wasn't any rich, buttery taste. The quality definitely justify the price of $14. (3/10)NZ ribeye ( medium rare) - tip: order a level below how well cooked you like your steak as it is serve on a hot plate and by the time the plate cools down it would have cooked the steak abit more .Potion of the meat is just right , about 250g. The quality of the meat is decent for this price. Comes with a side of baked potato and choice of sour cream, bacon bits and spring onions.Do avoid the garlic bread under you are very hungry though. It's free but usually comes cold."}

View from old frh is best as you can directly get a view of the ramganga river from your balcony. Couple of things to keep in mind while you plan:1. Mobile signal or land line not available2. Strictly vegetarian zone and no alcohol3. Smoking officially is not allowed but it's difficult to restrict smokers 4. There is a main restaurant that serves buffet breakfast@240, lunch and dinner @290/head5. There is a staff canteen which serves maggi and other snacks but on specific times6.

One needs to order drinks separately which is not part of the buffet. We went for a fruit punch (tasty) and date night (surpisingly tasted a bit like jaljeera but nevertheless good). We were already full with the starters but proceeded for the main course. The main course comprised of dal bukhara, hyd biryani (both tasty), methi malai paneer (paneer was rubbery), kashmiri kofta (yum) etc. They have a live pasta counter. I went for pasta in white sauce which was ok.Desserts were never ending with an array of pastries, cut fruits, gulab jamun (excellent!), kulfi (with toppings of your choice) and icecream.The place has a good ambience with extremely polite staff who were open to answering our questions. We were pleasantly surprised when at the end of the meal, one of the staff members brought a 'welcome to bbq' cake to our table (since this was our first visit here).

But what I was eagerly looking forward to was the sizzler! Unfortunately I was disappointed. The food was very bland. The veg kebab (part of the sizzler) had too much cornflour coating. The vegetables were slightly raw. All in all I did not like the food much. I felt that this was either over hyped or maybe non vegetarians have it better here."}

For some reason the misal tasted sweet (i think they use a bit of jaggery in the dish) and the sweet bread slices dont help either. Also, the 'rassa' doesnt deliver. They dont serve lassi, so I had to content myself with the kokum and nimbu paani (didnt taste great either. was watery).

Since we had elders with us, we were wondering how a hotel like this could have non functional lifts. The rooms provided were clean but we soon discovered that the intercom was not functioning with a non functional tv and ac. The technicians were called to repair the same. Although the TV and AC started working, the intercom facility(we were told) was not available. We had dinner consisting of simple daal, chawal which was pretty decent. They provide complimentary breakfast comprising of upma, dosa etc. The person taking the orders (forgot his name) was quite attentive and catered to our customised orders as well.At night we discovered the floor on which we were staying was occupied by a huge group in different rooms who kept drinking, smoking throughout the night and also created a lot of commotion which surprisingly was ignored by the hotel staff. To add to it, the intercom (which was not functioning for 2 days) suddenly starts ringing at 3.00 am in the morning and goes back to being dead.All in all the place is clean and the staff in the dining area was attentive.

Having read reviews previously we were a little reluctant to part with our hard-earned cash but we got discounted e-tickets which we purchased online the day before. Having been to Universal Orlando before, this simply doesn't compare. The rides aren't as thrilling and there is much less to do. However, it was a fun way to pass the morning and would recommend doing if you have a few hours to spare. As mentioned by other reviewers, it was very crowded and queues were huge. We got there at 9.30 and the queues were already 20 or so deep at the turnstiles. We planned our rides carefully and did the most popular ones first. We also used single rider which really cut down our queue time. If you are not careful, you can easily part with lots of cash - going over on locker time, food, drinks, souvenirs (all of which are over-priced) but we didn't actually spend anything other than the admission fee. We also took the opportunity to explore Sentosa Island and took the free shuttle bus to Fort Siloso (free admission and great for the history of the island) and the beach. All in all a good day out if your expectations aren't too high and you are careful with your spending. Top tip - use the Sentosa Boardwalk to get there (signposted from level 1 at Vivo City) rather than paying for the monorail or cable cars."}

We had a large party of travellers and in the build up to the stay we had many changes to our booking (adding and removing rooms etc) but Roberto, the hotel manager, was extremely accommodating, fair and patient with us. The hotel was in a perfect location for us - about 20 mins walk from the centre of Malcesine but along a beautiful lakeside path (steep hill down to lake but flat after that). The hotel faces a busy road but this never bothered us and the noise reduced significantly at night. There are one or two places to eat in the immediate area but many more in the town centre and the restaurant itself served some delicious and well-priced snacks. All areas of the hotel were spotlessly clean - wherever you looked there were people cleaning!! Rooms were spotless too and some had extra-large balconies with sunshine most of the day. The pool area was very well maintained, with plenty of sunbeds and parasols. We made great use of the pool but also enjoyed swimming in the lake (take some swim shoes with you if you want to avoid painful feet!!). Breakfast was very good and always fresh and well-presented. As most other reviewers have stated, the key to the success of this hotel is Roberto and his staff. Nothing is too much trouble for them and their English is very good. Roberto helped us to book restaurants and also got us a good deal on a day trip to Venice. All the other staff (Roberta, Andrea and Larissa) were extremely efficient and friendly, going above and beyond to make our stay memorable. This is a great value hotel too and it was helpful to be able to pay per room instead of per person. Even on the last day, we were offered access to a room with a shower, which made the wait for our late flight all the more bearable. All in all, an excellent value hotel in the most beautiful location!\n\n\nRoom Tip: Rooms at the back are quieter but tended to have smaller balconies.\nSee more room tips"}

The views from the villa are amazing and watching the sunrise from the balcony was well worth getting up for! Excellent pool area, which was very welcome in the intense July heat. Latchi and nearby Polis had many excellent eateries but car hire is essential (it was too hot to walk anywhere!).

They have renovated the rooms now. And the musty feeling is gone. Rooms are big compared ti hotels at the same rates offered in Singapore. They also throw in a breakfast. The bathroom and the rooms are comfortable and clean. Hotel staff id very helpful and courteous. This hotel in Jalan besar a main road very close to mustafa centre about 250m. Bus stop is just 200m away. Hotel does not have a curbside entrance rather you need to climb few steps and walk anther few to enter the hotel or use the ramp. The issue is forced if its raining as you cannot get out or in without exposing yourselves to rain. They offer good umbrellas on SGD10.00 Deposit. Please note that there is a rubber bathmat in the bathroom and to put it in the tub and to step on it as the tubsin this hotel a so smooth you will surely slip and fall. Be very very careful about this."}

Only issue we had is as they use stainless steel plates the food gets cold in minutes and if you try to relax you will end up with ice cold food in AC section and that is very bad. This is the reason I have given this place a rating of only 3 else it would be a 4 or 5 easily ."}

The booking was very easy and efficient via phone (being a local calling is an easy option). The check in was very easy. The lady who checked us in took us through it very efficiently and effectively. We were shown to our rooms quickly. The rooms are kept very well and maintained well mostly. I have stayed at many hotels in many countries and one thing to note is after a year rooms does not look like anything like the pictures on the websites. Not so here they look exactly like the pictures on their web site clean well-appointed and well maintained mostly. We stayed in room 140 and 141. The sliding door leading to the pool cannot be locked without a degree in Mechanical engineering. In 140 of course there was a deadbolt so we can lock it but 141 where they setup the triple and my children were in was not equipped with a dead bolt. And the lock takes precision movement and placement to lock. I donât think they check this ever management please fix all the locks that does not work at least on ground floor.Bathroom in excellent condition no cracks leaks or anything. Only thing to note is it takes about 20 to 50 litres of water to be wasted until hot water arrives. Even the maintenance staff admitted it takes a while for Hot water to come. What a waste of a valuable resource.Also in general service except check in and check out takes ages to come.We had our meals in Main restaurant and food was excellent. Choice is wide and very good for every meal. Enough Live food stations. Huge desert room with lots of variety. Salad bar is extensive every meal. Particularly like their Thai Dressing and different prepared salads.Only thing of note is waiters seems to wander around roaming rather than in pre assigned areas or tables. This creates a problem as the restaurant is quite big and if you are not on the main section then you may not be able to find a waiter for the entire meal. Pool is big and specious. Very clean. All of us had a lot of fun there. The Life guard on duty should stay on his post at all times the pool is open rather than entertaining gusts in the bar. The only big negatives I saw is that the way they program the room key and the time it takes for service to arrive. We were told that they need the rooms on the dot at 12.00noon on Sunday and we got everything ready and was going to check out on time. At around 11.55 me and my wife went to our childrenâs room to check the packing and bags to make sure everything was ready. Then we called the reception and told we are ready for check out. At around 12.02 we came back to our room and found we were locked out. We went back called the reception up and told them the situation. Even though they promised send someone ASAP nobody came for 20 minutes. Then called again nobody came called a third time around 12.45 nobody came walked down the corridor found a house keeping personal asked them to open the door and they did it. This is at around 12.55. So they strictly told us to give up the room at 12.00 noon at the check in itself. But no one came to collect baggage until 13.15 and no one responded to our repeated calls for assistance. I would rate service to be terrible but allowing it go one up and be poor considering the lady who did the check-in and the lady who made our booking both were very efficient courteous and professional everybody else well its terrible. In actual fact when I called housekeeping comer and sort out a plumbing issue one of the technicians who came is inebriated to such an extend I could smell the fumes from about 5 feet away.I have stayed at many resorts both in Sri Lanka and in other countries with varying levels and standards. But no hotel except this one has locked us out of our rooms before. I know for a fact that hotels do allow around 30 to 120 Minutes on the key cards to avoid such hassles. It was so in all the hotels that I have been to ones I reviewed and one I did not. Its fine if they want to program the key on the dot then the service also should be on the dot and the luggage collection should have come on the dot at 12.00 to my door or at least within 15 minutes is ok but 1 hour what is that?Itâs very clear that some sections like front office, House keeping the kitchen is running efficiently some other sections are plain lazy and unprofessional and it will be the downfall of this excellent property if not corrected very quickly.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Rooms 141,142 and 143 have great views of the sea. And don't get fooled by free Wi-fi its terrib...\nSee more room tips"}

The wall around the lake is called wall of clouds (walakulu bemma). During the British occupation the British hoping to crush the people of the country prohibited the conducting of rituals to the sacred tooth relic. And the country faced an unending drought and British them selves started suffer as their valuable tea plantations started to suffer. Buddhist civil noblemen at the time requested that the governor allow the rituals to be performed for the sacred tooth relic. The British reluctantly agreed. As soon as the relic casket was brought to the open torrential rains started to fall. The rain was so heavy that within few ours the lake was full and water strated to spurting through the decorative openings in the lake wall flooding the city. This flood is called dalada wathura (water of the sacred tooth).There are few other small incidents that are related around this lake.As a tourist attraction, well you can walk down the passage on the edge of the lake after your visit to the temple of the tooth."}

The selection of items are a lot and include vegetables, meats seafood both dried and fresh.Itâs a fantastic Experience but you should be ready to spend around 90 minuteâs minimum there.

With very economical prices itâs not going to be a problem.Each floor has its own specious Open area with comfortable chairs and a dining table with 4 settings so you can eat there or relax and even have a nap if you want Rooms are equippe with an LCD TV But if you need to view you need to tell Damith ( May be in Advance with the booking ) So that He can enable the satellite decoder else no TV.

We only had one breakfast which was real good and included tea coffee and local breakfast fare but we did not trouble Damith afterwards because he was facing staff shortage due to New Year and was having difficulty managing meal service. Being Locals we decided itâs better to let him tend to his guests from Abroad and found our meals outside. But on our next visit we will definitely be taking advantage of his fine culinary skills for sure.The guest House is about 2 Km from the Unawatuna Beach but donât think of it as an advantage because a ride to beach in a Tuk Tuk is only about LKR200.00(USD1.5) But this is an advantage as you can goto beach when you need but do not need to be exposed to high salty air all the time if you stay here.

After reading the reviews of Trip advisor site and seeing the hotel manager or someone writing as Hotel Manger called Melvin I decided to write to them and Ask the for a upper floor room away from the road and not on a corner room. Also I booked one of their Executive rooms thinking they may be better to my regret Upon Check-in I was given an upper floor room (308) it is the 3rd floor corner room and directly faces Jalan Beser. I never slept well for the whole of the 6 nights. When I found out I was given this room I went down to the reception and asked the lady for Mr. Melvin, from her reaction I gathered that Melvin is most probably not a real name as she went blank and asked me who is Melvin. Upon this I asked for the Manger and was told he is gone home.I am sure good old Melvin will say on his reply to this review that I should have come down next day and demanded a change of room. But I decided that itâs not worth the trouble as I have emailed them long before I checked in for the room. I was assured by Mr. Melvin he will accommodate me and then finding out that itâs not done, tells you the standards they adhere to. His reply is also there in one of my photos for everyone to see.Then I told her about my request but was told this is the biggest room they have and nothing can be done about it.So after a whole lot of trouble to get proper sleep I spent 6 sleepless nights with bed set in such a way in a corner with head at the road side itâs like sleeping on roadside. With traffic lights about 100M from the Hotel drivers start racing up as soon as the lights turn green. So you can imagine you being at the staring flag of the F1 races.Do not get carried away by looking at the replies from the Hotel âFrom Melvinâ These give you an impression that they care about you. The truth is itâs just and impression only.My friend stayed in room 307 for 2 days he requested a room with s window as he is suffering from Claustrophobia. We were told superior rooms comes with windows so paid SGD10.00 more for the window. When checked in we found no windows in the room. When asked from reception we were told that the window is in the bathroom can you believe it. I am sorry to say we wasted lot of money on this trip by booking bigger rooms and better rooms based on what hotel told us and ended up getting nothing for it. So please do not fall for room descriptions.The hotel This is an old building outside looks old. Insides are renovated. Lift is slow but works. Most of the time I took the stairs.Room even though I booked an executive is a corner room with a lot of road noise bed is set at one corner with head towards the road. There is a small table and a chair also a side table. A wall rack set about 6 feet up keeps all amenities including tea making things.You have hot water in the shower not on the sink. For the sink its only cold water. No Shower curtain so whole bathroom gets wet if you have a bath. No luggage rack or shoe rack so your bags stay on the floor no option. Lights are rather dim or low They should have at least one bright light.Internet is free but relatively slow compared to other hotels I have stayed in Singapore.The cleaning staff is very good. One particular middle aged lady served my floor most days and she is very efficient and surprisingly very fluent in English too. Room is kept very clean. Bedding is good, towels are good and Amenities are good.The breakfast is served at the bar cafÃ© ( by the way use the hotel site to book I did not found any difference in cost in any hotel booking sites and hotel site and if you directly use hotel site you get 2 breakfasts thrown in). Itâs a decent breakfast but they only give you 4 choices for free. The two good menus are chargeable but itâs good enough and I am happy with it. CafÃ© is also very clean and the staff is efficient and courteous too.MRT stations are about 10Minutes away. Mustafa Shopping Centre is 800M away. The Lavender food court is right in front of the hotel. Its open 24hrs and got real good variety of food. Getting about is easy from the hotel one bus or Short MRT ride for most places.They should install shower curtains and put a luggage rack for two standard bags and the bottom can become shoe rack in the room then its good value.Believe what travelers say on this site about this hotel. Do not believe comments from the Hotel on these reviews. I made that mistake. Also hoping to get a better room by booking executive room may be a waste also like in my case. So do not waste money.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Please make sure you have a room facing away from Jalan Beser else you are not going be able to slee...\nSee more room tips"}

To my surprise within two hours of my filling up the form the General Manager of the Hotel sent me a personalized email (with explanations and apologies for the facts I have shown in my survey) which shows that they care and if the other hotels in the chain show the same care for their guests which I am going to test in our next trip I will make this hotel chain my preferred choice of stay anywhere in the world.Overall a great place to stay if you have business in Noida Area"}

You have bus stops to several routes within 100 meters Bugis MRT is only 150 meters away. Bugis village , BHG, OG, Lumos, Simlim Square all within 500 meters. Itâs only about 1KM to Mustafa Centre if you walk through side roads. Food courts Restaurants all around. The hotel is kept spotlessly clean. Rooms are very very clean, Sheets are all very clean. They lay out good and spotless towels for you. But the rooms are getting old and worn out. (They are going to renovate the rooms according to the notice on the web site). Their Club upgrade gives you Evening cocktails (which has fallen below standard, used to be good earlier) Free internet, 2peices of laundry and free local calls There is no difference between club room and deluxe room. They now serve breakfast in 2 restaurants with Indian food only at level 5. Which means the choice is limited on both restaurants for breakfast which I do not like, but itâs less crowded now.The in room amenities are all very good but they give you this plastic spoon for making tea which is a joke (May be the guests are taking the Stainless steel spoons they put out earlier as souvenirs)On arrival the receptionist was able to pull out my record and to recognize the fact that I was a frequent visitor to their establishment and was treated with courtesy (She did this without passport number as I did renew my passport and she put the new number then and there only). Next day I went down to check if itâs possible to get late check out on our room and the lady on duty was very rude and said there is no provision for it but you must pay if you want late checkout even through at all my previous stays (I usually take a club room for internet the lounge access and late checkout they offer) I was allowed to stay until 16.00hrs minimum.( Their site page says so and is attached as a photo) This time they wanted to charge for a half a day. If they can give the room upon payment then the room is available and one must come to the obvious conclusion that now they want more money out of their guests. Bell Desk is ok but if you are a brown skinned like me then be prepared to receive substandard service from them( There was nothing like that 5 years or so back) as they must be categorizing us in to a substandard species).AddendumAfter this review was published the hotel management contacted me first via Trip advisor and then directly to my email to ask about the difficulty I faced. The assistant manager who contacted me was very helpful and concerned and has promised to look in to the problems. It tells a great deal about the Management of the hotel from the fact that they spent time going through our reviews and then actively trying to correct their erroneous ways and provide more attentive service to the guests. As such even though I was going to give up on them I decided to stay with them again. For which I am grateful as this is my favorite haunt as I am able to go to anywhere in Singapore very easily by MRT or Bus and for sopping you only have to step out of the back of the hotel."}

Amenities provided are excellentBut Beware the food is very bland at the main restaurant. I am surprised that located in a country famous all over the world for its tasty food how did his hotel went ahead and produced so bad foodIts not that they are half cooked or gone bad they are properly cooked and are in good hygiene. Itâs that none of the food has any taste. In a country where you have thousands of exotic dishes they make all the dishes bland.Also the Live food station personnel are very reluctant to prepare whatever they are making at the particular meal when requested and they go ahead and take a long time to do it and if we asked them to send it the table they promptly forget about it.I say this with confidence as I was forced eat 4 meals in the restaurant, that is until I found Taj is located stone s throw away from that day onwards I ate fabulously.

Rooms are not big but enough for 2 or 3 people. If you have 2 or 3 children and if they are near to age limit do consider an additional room. Very clean and new rooms (The hotel is new) .Hotel amenities are good. They provide soap, good towels toothbrushes toothpaste and razors etc. so good selection. No tea making facility through. All rooms have Wifi and is given free to almost all packages.They have a reasonably stocked bar with good bartenders. I had few drinks and cocktails and watched few games there.Restaurant serves a good breakfast with enough variety. Good quality food, fruits, coffee and for me its very good but its same food every day may be they change 2 items every other day. So if you expect a varied breakfast go to a food court outside. Reception is efficient friendly and helpful but since they have 500 odd rooms and mostly full its somewhat crowded so keep time for check out mostly if you are catching a flight ( My guess is you cannot ask to jump the queue as all most all the others will be going to airport).They have laundry service charges are normal for Singapore. More interestingly they have a small coin operated self-service laundrette where you can wash dry and iron a load for about SGd10.00 in about 90minutes.Location is fantastic. Sim-lim Square across the road. OG bugis next door, Bugis village at the back of the hotel so no end of shopping. About 5minutes walk to Bugis MRT, and lots of Shopping and food courts, Cineplexâs. Of course there are 2 bus stops right outside the hotel and you can get almost anywhere on a bus from one of those. F\n\n\nRoom Tip: get a highfloor room\nSee more room tips"}

The rooms are very small Shower Cubicle is actually only about 2 feet X 2 feet so you cannot soap or wash your lower body. They do not provide soap also ( may be because you cannot use it). Do not go their with families you will be cramped. Also you need to pay for every thing in this hotel Wifi SGD 12 for a day and expires after 24 hours from first log in even if you have used only for 5 minutes. Ff you are solo this is used to be good choice but now they have increased prices. This hotel is ok if the rate is about SGD100.00 beyond that donât pay you can get better hotels.Breakfast SGD12 a very bland and unsavoury offering. There is pool small but you need to bring towels from your room. On the bright side You have a âCopitiamâ a 24 hour food court under the hotel and MRT is also Under the Hotel and Lavender is only one station from Bugis which is centre of shopping.

According to Wicked Diving, it should take us about 2 hours to Rinca, thus giving us ample time to complete the other activities and return to Labuan Bajo at around 3:30pm. However as soon as we boarded the boat, we suspected that it has engine problems as it was going pretty darn slow. The captain insisted that everything was ok and said he would speed up after we exited the harbor. It never happened and the 2hr trip turned into a 3.5hr crawl! So much time was wasted!Our medium trek on Rinca Island was awesome though! It's very different from Komodo Island which we visited the day before, so it's worth visiting both islands. We saw less dragons at Rinca but truly enjoyed the panoramic view at the top of the hill. After Rinca, we headed to Pimpe Island to kayak. It was our first try at kayaking in the ocean and our guide Joe did a great job leading us. We enjoyed looking at the colonies of star fish and sea urchins. The coral reefs were beautiful under crystal clear waters. It was getting dark by the time we finished kayaking and the slow boat took us to Kelor Island. This is one Island you can skip as the water was dirty from floating rubbish from surrounding fishing village. We ended up not getting off the boat and decided not to snorkel as the sun wasn't shining bright anymore. In general, we felt that Joe our guide from Wicked Diving was good but we were very unhappy about the boat and the captain as he wasn't truthful about the condition of the boat. So much time was wasted on the boat and we had to forgo the snorkeling. I hope that Wicked Diving will do a better job at vetting the vessels before promising their clients a fun day of adventure."}

The layout is a little strange, as it fronts the Mailbox commercial property and this gives it some character, but does also create some odd spaces (such as the very small lobby).We stayed in a Club Room, which was nicely presented and gave a warm relaxing feel. The best was very soft, but otherwise fine and the windows insulated the main road outside brilliantly. The bathroom was quite basic and only provided a shower over bath, rather than a stand alone unit, which was a shame. Also there was no in-room safe, unfortunately.Parking is within the Mailbox main car park and even with a 15% discount from the hotel, is very expensive.Breakfast in the restaurant was very good, but we didn't eat there in the evening.All round, it's a good, comfortable hotel, that falls short of being great in a few minor areas."}

The hotel may be dwarfed by its newer neighbours but it has lost none of its class. We had booked the Pacific Rooms and were registered in a stand alone room by a pleasant young lady. Our room was on the 33rd floor and is accessed by a lift on the outside of the building. The room was spacious with plenty of wardrobe and cupboard space. The bed was huge, at least 6 foot. It had coffee facilities, a TV, fridge where all non alcoholic goods were free. The best thing about the room were the blinds and privacy screens that moved up and down electronically. The bathroom had a multi-functional walk in shower, toilet and sink. The room also came with a free mobile phone which could be taken out to use as a map and also afforded free local and international phone calls.Because of the room status we were able to use the Pacific Floor for breakfast (eggs cooked to order such as Eggs Benedict) together with an array of other foodstuffs, afternoon tea, sandwiches and cakes and cocktails and canapÃ©s in the early evening, this was enough to eat therefore alleviating the necessity of an evening meal. Every member of staff that we came into contact with was excellent and without fault. The room had no balcony but afforded views of the Singapore Flyer. My only criticism of my stay there was the tepid hot water from the tap at any time night or day but it had a long way to come which was in contrast to the piping hot shower. Thank all at Pan Pacific for making our Golden Wedding Anniversary stay so memorable. Hope to be back in ten years.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Rooms on all Pacific Floors. We occupied 3307\nSee more room tips"}

We arrived on time and were crowded into a lift to take us to the 57th floor together with people who were going to the observation deck the floor below. We were taken to our table which regrettably was not at the very edge overlooking the Singapore skyline. We ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio at $118 and a twelve dollar bottle of sparkling water. The choice of main meal was short rib without the bone for my wife and I had a roast chicken breast, it was a shame to have killed one so young. Both meals were nonetheless appetising with plenty of flavour. We selected two different desserts which we shared between us as we couldn't make up our minds which to have, they were very accommodating in this as they brought two extra plates for our use, they too were excellent. The bitter pill came when the bill arrived, with the obligatory 10% service charge and the 7% GST on top, the total came to almost $300.00 or Â£168.00. One must suppose that you pay for the view as well as the food. One draw back is that the bar is in close proximity to the dining area and there is an incessant thump, thump, thump of music (sic) being churned out by a DJ."}

The owner Charith is your personal butler and been in the hospitality industry for more than two decades. Clean and spacious rooms. Cable TV ( you don't need it!) safe sea bathing with professional coast guard service right throughout the day within 20 meters. Array of restaurants with 500 meters to choose your place to eat on the beach! Easy reach from CMB through the highway, less than 2 hrs. Cons: want to go back over over again"}

The tweaks \u0026 uplifts it's received have kept it fresh \u0026 fun (where Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom \u0026 Epcot are stuck in the past somewhat), although it's not upto the same standard as Universal, unfortunately.Hollywood Studios has mostly been given over to Star Wars, so if you're not a fan, there's about 50% of the park you're not going to like. For us, we loved it and had a great time over 2 days, doing all the rides \u0026 attractions (sometimes twice).We loved the fact that the old parade has been replaced by the March of the First Order, a Star Wars showcase and the spectacular evening fireworks and tribute / projection show - this is the best of all the Disney evening shows by a mile!The Stormtroopers that roam the park interacting with visitors are hilarious and the Cast Members playing the other Star Wars characters (Kylo Ren, Captain Phasma, Darth, Chewie, etc) are fantastic.As with other Disney parks: Entry is very expensive and we were mortified at the food prices, for what is very mediocre quality food. Even the table service restaurants are serving basic quality food at inflated prices, we were not happy. Some merchandise also seems to be quite expensive, with some items priced above UK Disney shop prices, which was very disapointing.Cast Members are hit \u0026 miss, with some being genuinely attentive, while others clearly need some customer service training.Fast Pass is a must and mostly works well, but there were some rides that were never coming up on the app, so we either had to stomach 60-90 min wait, or simply not do them. Some cast members manage the queues better than others too and sometimes the stand-by line simply doesn't move, as they release all the Fast Passers instantly, rather than just holding them for a couple of mins to keep the long suffering stand-by visitors moving.Hollywood Studios is the best Disney park by far, with some great shows and a really energetic Star Wars focussed buzz. Disney need to apply some of their creative thinking from Studios to their other parks, to bring them upto date."}

Entry is very expensive..... Â£1000 for 3 people on a 7 day pass is silly money. Thankfully this included Memory Maker and Fast Pass+, both of which are necessities.The next biggest issue is the food. The parks serve, almost without exception, very mediocre quality food, at silly prices. Even the table service restaurants are serving basic quality food at inflated prices, we were not happy. It was hard to find good quality or healthy food at the parks and the pricing was ludicrous. Disney need to sort this urgently.....Some merchandise also seems to be quite expensive, with some items priced above UK Disney shop prices, which was very disapointing.Cast Members are hit \u0026 miss, with some being genuinely attentive, while others clearly need some customer service training.Fast Pass is a must and mostly works well, but there were some rides that were never coming up on the app, so we either had to stomach 60-90 min wait, or simply not do them.

Much of the park hasn't changed since my first visit 25yrs ago, which is a real shame. The grounds are well kept and whilst it feels dated around Future World, nothing is tatty.There are some fab rides around Future World (Mission Space, Soarin \u0026 Tutle Talk) and the overhaul Test Track has received made it really good fun.Frozen Ever After never appeared on the Fast Pass app and had a constant line between 60 \u0026 120mins, which we simply weren't going to wait for.The World Showcase is well presented, but of limited fun for kids, which does make it a challenge with small ones.General Disney park comments (apply to all parks): Entry is very expensive and we were mortified at the food prices, for what is very mediocre quality food.

It's generally a great park, but it does need a major facelift on the front side (entry \u0026 Future World), as it looks like a 70's view of what the year 2000 would be, but now it just looks dated. Look past this and you'll have a good day at Epcot on some fab rides. Stay for the fireworks show at the end of the day and make sure to meet Baymax \u0026 give him a fist-bump (our favourite character meet of the whole holiday!).One final tip is that you can walk over to Disney's Boardwalk (path between \"France\" \u0026 \"UK\"), where you'll find better quality restaurants."}

Splash Mountain is also fun (although you'll be disapointed after trying Universal's Rip Saw Falls), as is the 7 Dwarfs Mine Train.Many rides are feeling very old \u0026 staid (Haunted Mansion \u0026 Pirates of the Caribbean especially), but can be fun for kids on a first visit.There is magic in Disney, of course and the atmosphere is generally great, it does mostly feel like a place to relax \u0026 enjoy, with some great scenery on Main Street and of course the castle. The parades \u0026 fireworks are spectacular, too.General Disney park comments (apply to all parks): Entry is very expensive and we were mortified at the food prices, for what is very mediocre quality food. Even the table service restaurants are serving basic quality food at inflated prices, we were not happy. Some merchandise also seems to be quite expensive, with some items priced above UK Disney shop prices, which was very disapointing.Cast Members are hit \u0026 miss, with some being genuinely attentive, while others clearly need some customer service training.Fast Pass is a must and mostly works well, but there were some rides that were never coming up on the app, so we either had to stomach 60-90 min wait, or simpl not do them. Some cast members manages the queues better than others too and sometimes the stand-by line simply doesn't move, as they release all the Fast Passers instantly, rather than just holding them for a couple of mins to keep the long suffering stand-by visitors moving.I'm conflicted by my visit and feel Disney have let the Magic Kingdom slide, rather than innovating and keeping it at the forefront of theme parks. Disney's own Hollywood Studios is a much better, fresher \u0026 enjoyable park and simply Universal blows it into the weeds for overall quality.Disney need to overhaul the Magic Kingdom desparately and review their pricing, especially for the poor quality, dramatically overpriced food."}

We went for the two day visit. We left our Adelaide hotel at 6.30am on a coach for a two hour journey to the Cape Jervis ferry to Kangaroo Island where we are met by our driver and guide Gaylene. With 2 Canadians, 2 Americans, ourselves we head for a rendezvous spot where we are to pick up another 2 Candians to make up our tour party. We then go out in search of kangaroos, wallabys and koalas. Our first stop was at Pennington Bay, just a photo stop. We next headed for our lunch stop, on the way gaylene spotted a tiger snake in the middle of the road apparently run over but still alive, she turned the bus around saw it was still living and turned again with the intention of getting off the road, whilst doing this another vehicle careened down the road and we assumed the worst, sure enough it was lifeless, Gaylene hopped out and using my walking stick removed the dead serpent into the bush. Shortly before stopping we had our first encounter with a wild Koala. We were taken down a track, through a gate and along another track where we were asked to alight and look for other creatures before lunch ready. We arrived at \"Harriet\" to find a tented area and a table bedecked with tablecloth, wine, salads, chicken and soft drinks, a Truly a wonderous spread, with cheesecake for afters. The rest of the day was taken up with seeing Roos \u0026 Koalas and heading down to Seal Bay to see the Sealion population close up. We then made our way for our nightly stopover in Kingscote. Morning found us heading to the airport to collect another traveller having lost one of the Americans. Our new arrival turned out toe a French woman. The second day followed a similar pattern to day one visiting Stokes Bay with its hidden beach, Pennington Bay with its high view scenic drive out, before moving onto the Flinders Chase National Park where we stopped for another alfresco lunch of lamb. Our final two visits were to Admirals Rock and The Remarkable Rocks after which we made our way to the airport and the ferry where we said goodbye to Gaylene who did us proud was was brilliant in her knowledge of flora and fauna and where to spot the different species. It was not until I was in the ferry terminal I realised that I had left my walking stick behind and I therefore bequeath it to Gaylene as her custom snake stick and my it have a long and useful life. I would recommend the company if you are looking for a small tour party trip. From Jean and I, many thanks."}

We were greeted by a very friendly Mrs Sally Douglas who ushered through the door to book us in. There was the smell of freshly baked bread permeating the hallway. We were shown to our room at the top of a flight of stairs to a lovely corner room overlooking the boats in the harbour. We had coffee and tea on the veranda and watched the world go by. The room was en suite with first class toiletries with a large walk in shower. The bed was so comfortable I had one of the best nights sleep for ages.Breakfast was excellent, my wife had hot cakes with banana and syrup. I had a divine omelette which was light a fluffy and full of cheese as I had omitted the basil and tomato they were very accommodating. My one gripe is that they tantalise their guests with the smell of fresh bread that they have to wait 12 hours before they can taste the brilliant Rye Bread. Thank you for having us, we really appreciate it."}

Phuket Adventures operate from a private site and pick up guests with their own bus fleet. Their building and port are very good, which helps guests feel relaxed. Staff are all very friendly and go out of their way to make sure you have a good trip. Our trip lead was the eternal joker Joon Joon and together with his crew, made sure we had a great time. These guys are the best assets Phuket Adventures have.The boat itself was good and while full, was not over-full, so guests were comfortable. The captain did a good job and made sure that despite the slightly rough sea, he sailed sensibly and kept things as smooth as possible. It's a shame that on the return one engine was playing up and we had to cruise back, slowly.On our Phi Phi trip, we saw some great sights, had two opportunities to swim \u0026 snorkel off the side / back of the boat in some lovely clear waters, with lots of fish. The lunch stop was very good and it was very cool to see the monkeys on the island.Now the not so good bits......This is a commercial enterprise and it shows in the \"extras\". There were a few extra-cost photo opportunities over the course of the day and the obligatory DVD. There's a cameraman with you on the whole trip and you're always reminded of the opportunity to purchase the disc at the end. We chose not to buy any of the ad-hoc photos, as we planned to have the DVD instead (thinking it would have plenty of pics \u0026 videos instead). The DVD is expensive at 1650 Baht, but we did barter on this price and got it cheaper. Unfortunately, the picture CD didn't actually contain any pics from our trip at all, which was a big let down, as we were shown plenty of pics on the cameraman's camera throughout the day! The movie disc was better and we did at least see as much of ourselves on there as we realistically expected, given we're on a boat trip with 20+ others and we're all \"staring\" in the same film. If you do a trip with Phuket Adventures, bear this in mind before you pay any money for the CD \u0026 DVD.The next thing to bear in mind, is the business of the locations themselves.... they're all very busy and packed with countless speedboats doing exactly the same trip. There's no privacy and it's hard to get any private landscape shots at all. \"The Beach\" (Maya Beach) itself is disappointingly busy and as with all other areas on the trip, the rubbish \u0026 litter is sad to see. While it was good to go to Maya Beach, it was too busy to really enjoy it.Finally, the last stop is at rip-off island. It seems most of the tour boats all stop at a disgustingly dirty, little sand island, covered in shanties selling drinks, snacks and trinkets, where the chief aim is to extract your last Bahts. We bought from a menu and once finished, the waiter attempted to overcharge us by 40% vs menu prices.... good job I remembered the advertised prices! As I noted the island is depressingly dirty and there must have been 30+ boats parked up, with hundreds of tourists sitting around, awaiting the call to go home. All told, we're glad we did the trip, but wouldn't do it again and couldn't really recommend it. From what friends told us, the James Bond trip is even worse for crowds, rubbish \u0026 tourist cash-extraction.If Phuket Adventures read this review, pls consider making a few simple changes to the day and you'll have very happy customers: 1, lower the price of the CD/DVD; 2, make sure you put the photos from the trip on the CD!!; 3, don't stop at the last sand island at the end of the trip; 4, try to find some less populated places to take your guests (although of course Maya Beach is where everyone wants to go and there's nothing you can do about the crowds there)."}

It is out of the main part of town on its own. We went in not knowing which door to use as people were using both. It took some time before anyone was bothered to ask us what we wanted. Finally, a woman took our order, mind you we had to ask at least five times, either she was deaf or couldn't understand our accents. The food when it finally came wasn't too bad although my wife said her fish cakes were not that hot which the chips certainly were. The establishment which also sells fresh fish needs someone front of house to project a better image."}

On arrival we made our way to book in for \"The Edge\" as there was a twenty minute waiting time, we were given a bleeper to let us know when to report. Our turn came and we were asked to put on shoe covers to protect the floor. There was a group of eight that entered the opaque glass box and we then we pushed out of the building 3 metres, suddenly all the glass cleared and we were suspended in thin air being able to see up, down and side to side. After photos had been taken it was gently returned to the building. A wonderful experience. We then departed the building. Later that evening we returned to the tower so that we could have a different perspective of Melbourne day and night. Worth the cost of $78."}

We are given a glass of sparkling wine to go with the Hummus and Capsicum dips which were very good. The next course was either Duck Terrine or Barramundi Fillet. The main course was either Roast Fillet of beef or Chicken these two courses were accompanied by copious amounts of Shiraz or Sauvignon Blanc. Finally, cheese and biscuits. Topped of with coffee and a chocolate. With a choice of liqueurs we choose the Baileys. They do not stint on the drinks either.

We were a bit concerned by the last minute switch, but as it turned out, there was no need to be and we had a fantastic time at Cape Panwa.The hotel itself is set on the side of a steep hill, across many levels, running down to their private beach. The common areas, reception, restaurants, bars \u0026 pools are all very well maintained, extremely well presented and welcoming. We found this helped to give our trip a very relaxing feel at all times.The hotel is actually two properties, with the main hotel up the hill and a second hotel / apartment complex at the bottom of the hill, on the main road. Residents at site can use the facilities at the other and there's a very handy FREE shuttle bus that runs throughout the day, until midnight, to get you between the two..... given how incredibly steep the hill is, this is a God-send!Rooms at the hotel are all suites of varying size / standard, although they are all huge, with private balconies and hot tubs (which we loved and made daily use of!). We have no real complaint about our room, other than the air conditioning being a bit sluggish and noisy and a slightly dated bathroom. Other than that, it was a lovely place to spend 10 days, with comfortable beds and almost total silence.The hotel has a number of bars \u0026 restaurants across both sites, catering for all tastes. The CafÃ© Andaman restaurant serves the main breakfast and then acts as a cafÃ©/restaurant the rest of the day. Breakfast is plentiful and most should find something they like, although there is no variety from day to day and I'd only give a 5/10 for food quality - it's all very mass-produced, buffet breakfast. That's where our food complaints end, as the lunch \u0026 evening service at CafÃ© Andaman were both fantastic, as was the food at the other on-site restaurants we tried.The beach cafÃ© (Bamboo), main Thai restaurant (Panwa House) and Uncle Nana's (Italian) all served fantastic food, at reasonable (hotel) prices. None of the restaurants were overly busy and it was always easy to get a table and prompt service.If you want more local food, there's a ton of restaurants down on the main road (take the FREE hotel shuttle down/back up the hill), where you can get most types of food in local settings for upto half the price of the hotel eateries. That said, we still found the hotel's prices to be cheap compared to UK restaurants, so we've no complaints on their prices really.For those not wanting to use the stairs to get between the main hotel \u0026 beach levels, there's a very handy (free) tram. We only used it once, but it worked well and thought it a very nice addition for the hotel to add \u0026 maintain.All the staff we encountered at the hotel were friendly, attentive and responded to queries swiftly, so we've no complaint there.One area we would recommend the hotel address, is the beach. It was very messy \u0026 disappointingly dirty. Each time we were down there, we were saddened to see so much debris \u0026 rubbish. If the hotel invested in a tractor and cleaning attachment, they could easily keep it as clean \u0026 tidy as it should be.Another nicety was the hotel's speedboat service. We took a complimentary trip out to a nearby island, which was a fun half day out, only let down by the slightly tourist-trap nature of the island (lots of pay activities, including the sunbeds!) and our captain getting the boat beached!We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the hotel and met many people who holidayed there every year, which is a great testament to the hotel \u0026 local area. We'll certainly return and would recommend the hotel to anyone.\n\n\nRoom Tip: As for a refurbished room and if you can afford it, go for a pool villa\nSee more room tips"}

From very reasonably price (mostly locally hand made) goods, to side-shows and the enchanting Thai Village.For some attractions / photo opportunities you're expected to tip, but for much on it, you can happily browse without being harassed.As for the show itself, it's absolutely fantastic! If you've not seen a Cirque du Soliel show you'll be blown away, but if you have you'll appreciate the hard work, effort \u0026 practice that goes into such an epic performance. From the elephants, to the acrobatics, it's a fantastic, informative and entertaining show, for all the family.

The elephant was left to wonder on its own and rarely did she need course correcting with a gentle nudge of the Mahoot's feet. Afterwards, we got to feed \u0026 pet her, before she went off for a rest.Photos and souvenirs are all very reasonably priced (almost cheap) too, which was refreshing.All told, we can't recommend Sian Safari enough, they're a fantastic group who clearly put a lot of effort into providing a relaxed, we'll run business with the well being of their animals at their core."}

I ordered a cottage pie and the pie of the day (chicken \u0026 mushroom) both were quite obviously freshly made and of a large size. My wife enjoyed her cottage pie and veg but was unable to finish off such a large dish but declared it to be lovely. My massive pie was full to the brim with a lovely light pastry. Whether it is normal to put pepper on the chips I do not know but I found that it spoilt them, I would ask the diner first before doing so as not everyone wants it.

You are then asked to go through an airport style security gate and are then whisked up to the observation deck in a lift that does it in less than a minute. The next procedure is to book in for the walk. At your appointed hour all loose items are stored in a free locker, you done a fetching blue one piece and then through another screening before donning a harness and being secured to a safety rail you step outside onto the deck. E then climbed a few stairs where the breeze becomes apparent. We went round part way until we stopped on a glass bottomed floor where we were encouraged to jump up and down as a group to test its two elephant weight scale, needless to say we puny humans could not budge it. After a series of group and individual photos we go round the other side where our host extended the floor outwards so that we are able to see straight down. We were then led back inside after at least fifty minutes. Our mentor for this trip was a personable young man by the name of Lawson who was very informative regarding our surroundings and enhanced the walk, thanks Lawson great job. I would urge everyone who has the chance to do this. It ultra safe and I add that I have a healthy respect for heights!"}

We arrived to find that the cloud had descended into the valley so other than seeing just wet rocks we moved on to our mid morning stop to a scone and drink. He then took us Echo point but again the cloud was so low we could see nothing and it started to rain. Ian had gone off to obtain tickets for the Scenic Cableway etc. We waited a couple of minutes before he returned. As we had lost two guests in the mist he took us to a nearby waterfall whilst he went back to find them, by the time we had gone down eighty odd steps, took photos then climbed back up he had the two in tow. Off up to the cableway, he showed us where to go and took off. We went down the short ride and there was Ian with the vehicle to return us to the top. Our next ride was in a cable car which again took us to the bottom, this time Ian accompanied us as at the bottom were several walks through the rainforest where he explained what had gone on when coal mining was in operation. We then ascended in the inclined railway which was so steep my wife had difficulty staying on the seat. This way of doing this misses out the obligatory photo shoot. He then took us on to the next valley to show us the contrast in the valley floor from rainforest to agriculture. Onto our stop for a late lunch before returning to the outskirts to pick up a charter boat to take us to Circular Quay which rounded off the day. This is a small company who do not hesitate to refund if the weather is bad (not many companies have this philosophy) they are very good in what they do and I am pleased that my money has gone to a thoroughly excellent company. Well done to all especially Ian who gave us such a wonderful day. My advice, go small to the Blue Mountains, you will not regret it."}

Day 1. was being picked up at 5.15am to drive to Kata Tjuta National Park to see the sunrise. It was a trip of some 40 Kms being driven by Alicia and guided by Wally. At the sight we were taken to a viewing point a fair distance from Uluru to see it rise to the right as we looked. The bus was full with eleven of us and the sight chosen was virtually just us. The sun came strong and bright. From there we were taken to Kata Tjuta Gorge where the rising sun played off the Gorge walls. We didn't make it up to the end as it was too much for us though we did make it over half way. We descended just before the main group arrived back. We found both our guides knowledgeable and friendly who we're able to answer our queries. We were returned to our hotel at 10.30am. At 3.30 we were outside ready for our second tour of the day. We were met by our driver and guide Gary and again we had a full bus of eleven. We were taken direct to Ayers Rock where we debussed and Gary explained to do's and don'ts with regarding to the sacred sites that we should not take photographs at. He also showed us where people climb to the top via a pathway with only a low chain to hold onto for safety. He explained the reason for it being low was that the government wanted it to be at waist height but the person commissioned to do the job was only 160mm! We were then taken to a small depression in the rock face eroded over millennia to form a small cave, this is where we were able to touch the rock face. Further on we visited another sight where wall art could be seen. We then went to the rear of Uluru away from the crowds where our little group were treated to drinks as the sun went down. We were returned to our hotel around eight thirty. Gary was an excellent host, full of knowledge and was able to answer questions that were thrown at him.Day 2. We were collected at 9am by again Wally and this time Jessica. Our bags loaded we were off to Alice Springs in Two days. The route is quite often featureless with dry grasses, shrubs and trees littering the landscape. Wally tried to make things interesting by giving us facts about who built the road and the mountain ranges. After a couple of hours we pulled into a rest stop where they produced a lovely breakfast which was eaten leisurely. We then headed for Kings Canyon. At around 1pm we pulled into Kings Creek Station where we had a lovely lunch of a steak and onion sandwich. Finally arriving at the canyon where we went for a walk in the National Park. It was not a particularly hard walk where various trees and bushes were explained to us, we even had time to photograph a lizard. From there we travelled to our overnight stop where we availed ourselves of a short helicopter ride over the rim at a cost. Dinner was served in the Desert Oak Bistro where we all sat together and discussed the day and other topics.Day 3 started early as they wanted to get going before the heat arrived. We had breakfast and were off. We cut a lot of mileage by taking the dirt road which in places was a little rough, we even went through roadworks! Finally back onto tarmac we arrived at the Finke River where we pulled of and had a very good lunch. We finally arrived in Alice around three where we were taken to our hotel and we had to say goodbye to our companions. I have nothing but praise for these two individuals, they kept us fed, entertained and imparted a tremendous amount of knowledge during the two days and both my wife and I were sorry to see them. Good luck to you both in the future. Please book this tour it is worth every cent. This is a company that likes to keep things small and personal, good luck in the future I cannot praise you higher."}

At dinner the place was very busy, it is just as well that we had booked. We ordered drinks and a Seafood Pot Pie. The pie topping was a mashed potato pipped circle that had been oven baked. The contents were Mussels, prawns and fish in a white wine sauce and was truly delicious. We declined dessert as the pie was filling enough as we had eaten breakfast and lunch en route. Breakfast was a different matter, although it had the normal fare and I was fairly full from the night before I ordered the Eggs Benedict. It came with eggs cooked as I had requested but the whole thing was spoilt by the hollandaise sauce which had far too much mustard in it. It was unpleasant to say the least. My advice is use a mild mustard or us only a small quantity."}

Still, there's a lot they could do to the park to improve visitors' experience.Food on site is quite poor and very expensive. This was a big disappointment and our second biggest gripe after the queues...We didn't get to see more than half of the attractions, simply because of the awful queues. Some rides took more than 90mins to queue for, despite the attraction durations being surprisingly short. It felt like the park's Fast Pass was chiefly to blame for this, as it allows pass holders to jump the queue and get absolute priority. On a number of occasions we were about to be let onto attractions, only to then be pushed back as yet another family with an expensive pass rounded the corner and took our place. On one ride, we waited stationary for 20min while Fast Pass family after family turned up and were chauffeured onto the ride ahead of the general queue. This system only works for the people willing to spend what is a LOT of money on their passes and completely spoils the experience for everyone else. A better approach would be of providing entry times for each attraction, as Alton Towers do. Also, there's no need to offer Fast Pass for every ride!The park itself is a good size and it's not a problem to get around it on foot. The new Friends area is very well presented and aside from the cringeworthy overly Americanised stage show, was a great setting.Other areas are looking a little tired and lots of the Lego sculptures and faded and dirty, which is a bit of a shame.Highlight of our visit was the Big Shop, of course and we spent far too much money in there! A tip we'd offer is to go there early in the day, but your goodies and collect them later. At the end of the day it's hell-on-earth in there, with hundreds of people falling over themselves to buy merchandise.On the whole we enjoyed our time in the park, chiefly on the basis of it being a very cool place which makes everyone feel like a kid, but the prices, poor food and queues did take the edge of it, unfortunately.If you've been to Alton Tower or Disneyland, you could be a bit disappointed with LEGOLAND, as there's a lot they could learn from their competitors to make it a truly fantastic experience."}

We spent almost 7 days at this resort as it was convenient for our tours and the town. It has has a very nice pool that is split into certain parts for children etc. It is in full sunshine for ninety per cent of the day, there are adequate sun loungers and a bar. The accommodation is of a good quality, we were upgraded to a ground floor suite as the girl booking us in realised that the upstairs room allocated was not suitable (thanks). It had a living room/kitchenette, a separate bedroom and walk in shower bathroom. It was well equipped although no toaster. All in all a good place to be, however, my gripes are these. There is no bar open until at least 10.30 am at the pool and that rarely occurs and the bar in Estilo doesn't open its doors until 3pm, not something you would expect on a holiday hotel. The other was the cost of Breakfast and Dinner, the costs are A$28 per person (Â£17.50 approx) and A$65 (Â£40.60) I know they have a captive audience but that is extracting the michael. Perhaps if costs were lower they would have more diners. The reception staff were first class at every question I posed to them, they could no have been more helpful. WIFI is excellent. I would have awarded an extra half mark if the scoring had not been 1 - 5. They also have a guest laundry with three washers and four dryers each requiring 3 one dollar coins to operate them. See reception for coins and detergent."}

Since it's closure it's been bought by the Lovely Pubs group and their refurbishment has lead to an almost unrecognisable establishment.What a transformation, from front to back the pub is amazing. Lovely furnishings \u0026 touches abound, it's a great place to visit. The open fireplaces crackling away are a delight especially.The main restaurant is beautifully presented, but the bar \u0026 front dining room are equally inviting, with a more relaxing atmosphere.The food was lovely and we'll certainly be going back to try some other menu items, especially as the specials are updated regularly and we want to see what the huge tent in the back garden is all about!!All told, we can't fault the Moat House. It was very busy and according to the staff, it has been since the re-launch, so reservations are essential. We were lucky to grab the table as walk-ins.It's a shame the car meets won't be taking place there any more, but that's really only because they're too busy (even during the week) to accommodate, so hardly a bad thing!!We've absolutely recommend the Moat House to anyone, just ensure you call ahead to book."}

Not good for a freezer-to-grill semi-DIY burger joint.I was immediately wary when our starter arrived within about 3mins of me ordering, making me think the food was pre-cooked and warmed over to order. Mains arrived just as quickly. The food tasted OK to begin with (maybe helped by the sauces, I'd added!), but then became bland \u0026 stodgy. As this was our evening meal, we ate nothing else afterwards and went home..... unfortunately during the night, my wife \u0026 I started getting stomach cramps and begun feeling ill. 48hrs later, we're still both ill.My wife complained and it turns out that some of the food we'd eaten was de-frosted 2 days before we ate there. According to the lady my wife spoke with, food is bought in frozen and thawed / cooked when needed.... clearly, this process and the cooking itself isn't upto scratch.The lady my wife dealt with was apologetic and gave us 25% of vouchers. We won't be using them.As others have said the staff are poor (not helped by the \"pre-pay at the desk\" concept which gives the staff little scope for tips) and except for the music videos, the place has no atmosphere at all. When we were there, we were sat by a large group of folks talking loudly (not in English), but not eating at all. We assumed they were the owners / operators or their family and were just in there loafing around.I'm afraid this place is simply awful on all levels. The concept doesn't work, the food is frozen rubbish that they clearly can't cook properly and I've been served my more engaged staff at McD's.I thought we were just unlucky and wasn't going to write a review, but I can see from what others have said that this isn't the case. Unless something drastic changes, this place will not last.I will just balance this by saying that the milkshakes were lovely, so at least something is working there."}

We got back on board, having our badges checked (no interlopers for our Vivian!) we were given a small snack of cheese and tomato pesto sauce plus biscuits, prune and apricot. They finished it off with a mango sorbet. They did not stint on the drink either. The views were excellent with the engineer slowing the train at certain places for photographs. The scenic part of the journey could have been better if the would only cut down the rainforest but I don't think that they will do that. (The last sentence is tongue in cheek)"}

Went in and sat by a window looking out onto the forest. We ordered drinks, a beer and Diet Coke. Beer arrived with a glass whilst the Diet Coke was also in a glass and lukewarm! Not a god start. The waitress was tardy in taking our order. My wife ordered steak pie and chips while I ordered fish and chips. The pie was warm inside but the crust was tepid at best, obviously been a a microwave! The fish although tasty enough had never seen tempura batter in its life as advertised on the menu, it had the look of something that had been frozen. My advice would be go elsewhere as there must be better eateries in this town."}

We were given boarding cards and told to proceed to the boat. We were meet by the very charming Charlotte who relieved us of the cards and asked us to board after removing our foot ware. In the end there were a family of six Australians, three Americans and my wife and I on a boat that can carry up to three times that number. We were given a safety briefing by Greg and the skipper Steve then gave a brief synopsis of what was to come asking also if anyone has problems on the sea which I concurred. Using the engine power we made our way to Low Isle. We picked up the glass bottomed tender and made our way into calmer water. The weather across was glorious. We used the tender to transfer to the beach were we disembarked. I should say at this point that we had clamboured into a very tight Lycra suit to protect from jellyfish that are rather potent in these parts. We went off shore to see the amazing corals and sea life, whilst following a green turtle another came up on my shoulder nearly brushing me. Back on board the main vessel we are served lunch consisting of meat and fresh prawns with fresh fruit after. Some people thought it was their right to monopolise the prawns and the fruit, indeed one person took all the honeydew melon whilst another of their group went for the prawns. Anyway, after another swim we head off back this time under sail. What a serene way to travel. I produced an offering to the sea which brought three 4 foot black fin sharks for everyone to enjoy. We had a throughly good day out. Congratulations to Steve, Greg and Charlotte for making us so welcome and being so informative. Book this trip is all I can add. Finally in the office awaiting the transport, a gentleman got into a somewhat fraught discussion regarding a non payment. It resolved itself in the end but not before he had accused the girl of being rude, more him than her as she had the patience of Job."}

When alighting at each stop you are able with or without a ranger to follow pathways explaining the flora and various look outs especially at the second stop where there are three such points. The whole trip with wanderings takes over an hour. We were lucky in that there were no queues so we had one two ourselves. I would recommend this to anyone visiting the area.

Had to wait 15 minutes or so for my order of blue Cod and chips, the thing that hacked me off somewhat was the slogan on the paper bags that they came in which said \"why wait in line when you can order on line\" wish I had known earlier!

This roof-top romantic restaurant has 2 sections â the hookah section and the food section. Am not a smoker but I do like to have a few puffs of the hookah when I get the opportunity. The mint and paan flavoured hookah was really good. I have heard smoking a hookah is more hazardous to health than smoking cigarettes. So, mind it.Once we were done with the hookah, we moved to the food section where we sat at a table that had a tent-like set up with a pretty lantern glowing in the middle. We could see the beautiful moon and the stars through the roof. The starters, Stuffed aloo till-walla (in this, they stuff a sesame seed covered potato with grilled vegetables, paneer, spices and bake it in a tandoor) and Papad roll (here, they stuff a fried papad with a vegetable filling) were lip-smacking. The main course, Nizami tarkari pilaf was lightly scented with Indian spices and the aromatic saffron. Coupling it with the kachumber raita added to the taste.My non-vegetarian friends enjoyed the Nawabi chicken kabab and the Dum murg biryani. We even liked the kulfis. The jal-jeera was a bit too salty though. Koyla does not serve alcohol.. hmm..The whole experience reminded me of the famous Desert Safaris of Dubai (sans the belly dancers, of course).It will be a great place if you want to impress someone on a first date!"}

Was keen to enjoy their food, service and ambience but, didnât get to experience any of that, thanks to their thoughtlessness.A couple with their infant daughter, my husband and I wanted to check out this restaurant. We called to book a table. They asked how many people we needed the table for. We said 4. The reservation was made. Reached and met an usher at their entrance. She confirmed to us about our reservation but wouldnât let us in as we had an infant with us. We told her that we had driven for 18 kms and for an hour and 15 mins to get here and requested if she could get us a table. She was uptight and shrugged. Said that it was a strict management policy. We were so disappointed and upset and lets not forget, hungry!!Â A restaurant having such a policy is up to them but the simple thing would have been to inform us during reservation that they do not let children in. The usher was totally rude and unapologetic and she even had the audacity to say that they have these kind of cases all the time!! This goes to show that success has got to them and now they do not care about customers. But itâs the time and age of technology where not only the good word spreads, the bad word too.We drove down to Mainland China which was close-by and they were more than happy to serve us!"}

If you can manage it, you MUST see it at sunrise. That gives you an opportunity not only to see the temple complex when it is less crowded, it gives you an experience you will never forget. I was there at 5. The sky was over cast and the sun rose behind the clouds to give a crimson-pink-peach-orange kinda sky. With the silhouette of the templeâs Gopuras and the reflection of the same in the lake, it was simply beautiful, the most beautiful sunrise Iâve seen. The temple itself is huge and thereâs lots to walk and climb. So, wear comfortable clothes and flat footwear. Do hire a guide or its like walking through a maze. I don't find the carving too intricate here. I have seen very intricate and ornate carving in some temples in India (states of Karnataka and Rajasthan)."}

Everyone was friendly, courteous and helpful, we couldn't have asked for more.The main hotel itself is a very old building, that's been kept true to it's heritage. Some of the furniture pieces must be almost as old as the hotel itself! It's refreshing to see a hotel embracing it's heritage, rather than trying to be modern \u0026 \"boutiquey\".We stayed in the lodge building, which is more modern, but still retains the quaint feel of the main building.The spa is set away from the main hotel, down near the lake and is a great addition. Again the staff are all first class (especially the treatment team) and the new building is very well kept \u0026 presented. The pool isn't the warmest indoor pool, so you'll not just lie back \u0026 relax in there, you'll have to swim to stay warm ;-) The sauna \u0026 steam room were great and the outdoor hot tub is awesome.Food at the hotel is a great as the rest of the hotel, although the evening meals are a little pricey, so I'd suggest taking a hotel deal that includes an evening meal as we did.To all the staff at the Lake Country House hotel, a big thank you from my wife \u0026 I, we hope to see you soon!"}

The PP is a good 4-star hotel, but it's certainly not a 5-star as advertised (or \"Premier Plus\" as Thompson advertised it).Hotel Common Areas:This is easy: beautiful \u0026 well maintained. Walking around the hotel is a pleasurable experience and all the bars / restaurants / walk ways / grounds / lobby areas are very well presented. For this, I can't fault the PP.Rooms:Above average, but showing their age (the hotel is around 8yrs old I believe). We moved from our first room as it had 2 small double beds (one for my wife \u0026 I and another for our 4yr old daughter). The beds were a waste for the baby and too small for us! We were moved to a room with a large queen and a temporarily squeezed in single bed, down in the \"living room\". This 2nd room was smaller than the first by a good 30% and had a broken whirlpool bath \u0026 thermostat. The bath didn't wok at all and the thermostat would only turn the AC on or off (it couldn't hold a prescribed temperature). We couldn't be bothered with packing up our clothes and moving for a 2nd time, so we lived with it.Also in the 2nd room the TV was a lot smaller (28in vs 42in approx) and the reception was worse than the first room. No big deal as we were only in there to change / sleep, so again, not worth complaining about.The bathroom showed it's age with an old shower-over-bath setup. The bath was very slippery and no mats were provided (the baby fell over and cut her chin in the mid-holiday :( ). The rest of the bathroom was spacious clean (no mould / damp).The mini-bar is kept stocked as are the 4-optics, which were a surprising \u0026 nice touch.The rest of the room was spacious enough \u0026 kept clean to a good standard.Food \u0026 Drink:Average to good (at times). Main Buffet Restaurant: always busy and has a huge choice of food at breakfast, lunch \u0026 dinner. If you can't find something to your tastes in here, there's something wrong! 3 large \u0026 varied hot food stations are complimented by 4 cold food areas. The choice is huge. That said, we found that hot food isn't kept warm enough and often food is undercooked. Regularly we'd get to our table and find we had a plate of luke-warm food. We were never ill from food, so meats were generally cooked well enough, but rarely was anything piping-hot, which did take the edge of it somewhat. Tables could be kept cleaner and we weren't happy to see waiters simply turning table cloths over after guests left and then preparing the table for the next diners! Very dodgy practice for any star of hotel, appalling for a supposed 5-star. Many people are clearly there to just eat epic amounts of food, which amazed us regularly! Special mention to Janet who always looked after us and greeted us with a huge smile at every sitting :)Steak House: Poor. Any place that serves only 1 steak, of questionable quality, 10mm thick, with a rubbery quality has no business calling itself a steak house! We went back a 2nd time incase we'd had an off-experience, but it turned out we didn't. We didn't go back. Other guests were speaking with at the hotel said the same. Major let down as we love a good steak.Mexican Restaurant: Very good. We went back twice and had lovely meals each time. Just be careful eating the chillis ;-)Japanese Restaurant: Probably good...... I only say that as it was very sushi heavy and that doesn't appeal to us. We wanted to try it to ensure we'd given all restaurants a shot, but unfortunately it wasn't to our tastes. If you're a sushi lover, give it a try you might love it.... if not, best give it a miss.Fusion Restaurant: Bloody brilliant! The best food we ate at the hotel by a long way. Can't fault it in any way. If you're travelling with under 12s, they won't be allowed in, so you'll have to get a babysitter. The hotel can provide 'sitters, but it'll cost you 15USD per hour and in our experience, it was a pain to get one booked. We're glad we did though as the restaurant was great.Sports Bar: Below par. It was a real empty space. The bar is in the middle'ish of the room and then seats etc are pushed out to the edges. Every time we went in there it lacked atmosphere and on one occasion the knackered pool table ate our money and the hotel staff were very un helpful (you have to pay to play). Both pool tables are shot, the cues are as straight as a boomerang (some missing tips) and there's no chalk. The air hockey table is similarly knackered providing a cushion of air barely able to lift the puck. The \"24hr snacks\" provided here are in fridge and there's a microwave for your convenience!! I wasn't brave enough to try microwaved burger \u0026 chips, I'm sorry.Lobby Bar: Very good. Well appointed, lots of tables, no complaints.Drink Quality: Even the water is watered down! Absolutely everything is watered down and everywhere except for the veranda bar served very weak cocktails. The penny pinching was evident with the drinks and really annoyed us. My wife stumbled across some decent wines, but the only drinkable beers were in bottles. Draft beer was very weak \u0026 watery. I was a bit upset there was no Corona on offer anywhere, just 2 local brews that tasted like cheap supermarket stubbies. Don't expect good quality drink at any time, unless you find \u0026 stick to one of the wines.Staff:Animation Team: Very hard working! Pepe \u0026 his team are constantly on the go, always happy \u0026 smiling and work their absolute hearts out. Even if some of the evening shows aren't quite award winning, there is huge effort in them. To be fair, we enjoyed most of the shows in the theatre and I'd go as far as to say the evening entertainment was the best we've seen at any hotel anywhere.Waiting Staff (Restaurants): Very hard working and usually providing high levels of service. Occasionally your drink request might get forgotten but, only rarely. Again, hat's off to Janet, she always did a great job.Waiting Staff (Drinks): Very hard working and gracious. Whether around the pool or in the bars / theatre, the waiting staff work extremely hard and constantly ensure you're watered. Sometimes the drink wait time can be 10min'ish, so it's worth ordering before you actually want the drink.Front Staff: Generally very good. My only complaint was when they wouldn't refund me from the dodgy pool table. Otherwise, they were always attentive and very agreeable.Pool:Below Average. The size of the pool is great and we did enjoy swimming in the main pool \u0026 smaller upper pool. Unfortunately, poor maintenance let it down terribly. As mentioned by others there are literally hundreds of missing tiles waiting to cut / scratch you. The worst of which was in the swim up bar area where one table was missing a 300mm stretch of it's edging tiles leaving bare concrete - it looked awful and in such a prominent place was really unacceptable. Twice (in 2 weeks) I saw a chap in the pool fixing tiles.... he's jump in fix a tile or two, then disappear! There were hundreds to fix, what's the point of only spending 10mins every few days fixing tiles?! The pool was very scummy with a layer of oily residue (sun screen \u0026 spilt drinks, I guess) visible most of the time. Usually such hotels are constantly cleaning their pools to ensure they're clean, but oddly the PP give it a quick clean after 8pm, a bit of a check in the morning before 8am and then nothing. This was a big disappointment.The floor tiles around the pool were unbelievably hot after mid-day and you couldn't walk barefoot to the pool. There's got to be an external floor covering out there Riu could use that doesn't turn to volcanic rock in the afternoon sun, surely?!As mentioned by others, people are out there from 5am nabbing the sunloungers \u0026 parasols around the pool, which is really frustrating if you're a normal holiday maker not interested in setting a daily alarm for the crack-of-the-crows. Riu need to seriously do something about this as the greedy minority spoil it for the rest of us trying to have a relaxing holiday. The pool area being quite small for the size of hotel and rent-a-parasol beach policy doesn't help here, clearly.Beach: Average. Quite weedy with very rough sea. You'll not swim in the sea very often and will need to be a strong swimmer. Watch your kids out there. The area near the pool deck is a bit swampy, which isn't very nice. Worse of all are the parasols, which are charged around 10-15USD per day (I forget the exact charge, we only asked once and never paid... I thought this was 5* AI??).In Summary: It's a lovely hotel, with very hard working staff. The deficiencies noted in my review are based on my expectations against the brochure and experience working in the industry, travelling to hotels globally for my job. If it was billed \u0026 priced as a 4-star, much of this wouldn't be an issue as I'd expect some foibles. Unfortunately, for Riu, not only have I experienced many genuine 5-star hotels, but also number of 4-star establishments that would rate higher than the PP.If you go expecting a few rough edges, you'll have a good time. We had an open mind, accepted a few issues and it didn't impact our stay. We had an enjoyable and relaxing time, thanks chiefly to the very hard working and extremely pleasant staff. While it's not 5* luxury, it is a solid 4 and a should provide a comfortable stay for anyone.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Internal rooms overlook the central hotel area and will be noisy at night due to the theatre\nSee more room tips"}

This gives 30mins in the water, which we thoroughly enjoyed. Our trainer Ako was very friendly and did a good job of ensuring everyone enjoyed the experience, especially our 4yr old daughter (she let me do 2 swims, the second one with our little girl holding onto my back!). It's a fairly brief experience and quite pricey, but I'd suggest it was worth it for a special experience.What I did have an issue with, however, was the price of the photos. The basic photo package for a coupe (the little one wasn't counted) was more expensive than the swim for one person, the pics came in at Â£85 at current FX! This did reek of profiteering and all the people in our group felt the same, but felt they had no choice but to purchase them if they wanted any kind of memento. You can't buy single pics (Â£85 is the \"starting\" price) and spectators aren't allowed anywhere near the pools to take pics either, so it feels extremely aggressive and took the edge off what would have been a fantastic trip."}

We were lucky with the boat ride, as it was direct (some go via PV, which adds another 30-40mins) and the waters were relatively calm. 60 mins wasn't a bother and there's snacks \u0026 drinks provided by the VA team on-board, as part of the package. As part of the experience, it's a nice run out, but the return is a little tedious as it seemed all people wanted to do was get back to their hotel (it's an 11pm return departure).Upon arrival, it's all very \"wow\". The lady on a 12ft bendy pole was very cool, as were the other characters dotted around, welcoming the visitors in. It all sets you up for the show nicely and gets you in the chilled out mood.The show itself is very well done, extremely polished, with good music, a well designed \"theatre\" and above all, very impressive \u0026 engaging dancing. The whole experience was developed with support of some Cirque du Soleil staff and it shows. Aside from being a bit short (about 40mins), its hard to fault the show itself, we really enjoyed it.After the show, we moved to one of the restaurants for dinner. Unfortunately, as soon as we set foot into the restaurant an absolutely massive storm hit and thanks to the wind it was blowing rain halfway into the restaurant itself. The staff were then in full panic mode trying to move people and unfortunately were on the back-foot from there. The weather wasn't the staff's fault, of course, but given tropical storms are a regular occurrence during the late summer, I'd expect them to be better setup to cope when it does hit.Once things calmed down and dinner was served, we had a thoroughly lovely meal. The food was all well cooked and there was plenty of variety. It was one of our best meals on the holiday, we couldn't fault the quality at all. The ambience of the candle-lit dining room was really nice, but it was a little too dark and a little bit of electrical help wouldn't have gone a-miss, or ruined the ambiance at all.The whole area of Las Caletas itself is beautifully developed, maintained and presented. Just walking around in the candle-light is a pleasure, although there's not much time to do so, as no sooner is dinner finished, then the bells are ringing to get you back on the boat. Timing is an issue, chiefly because of the 60-90 min boat ride each way.On the return boat ride, the VA staff will bring round photos \u0026 music CDs to buy. This time a couple of pics and a CD only cost the equivalent of Â£18, so it's an acceptable purchase (unlike the Â£85 VA charge for the Dolphin photos).All in all, it's a must-do trip, but bear in mind the boat ride will have you out late and cross your fingers it doesn't rain!"}

The food is a big disappointment too, being some of the worst we ate on our holiday.

We stayed there last week with our baby and friends (another couple), but we all agreed we wouldn't go back.Positives:The pool is very good. As per the pics on this site, it's HUGE! It was also warm and we thoroughly enjoyed using it after long days sight seeing in the sun. The underground car park is convenient and the site is generally clean / well kept.We had a 3 bedroom suite (more of that later...) on the back of the property overlooking the mountains. It was a great outlook and while it wasn't a swim up room, the pool was right outside the front door, so no worries there.The kitchen was well equipped and I'd expect it would cater for anyone's holiday needs.The main bathroom in our suite was spacious and the patio doors on the back of the shower (opening into the enclosed courtyard) was a funky touch.Now the negatives.....We were travelling as 2 couples and a baby. We asked for 2 rooms, one of which with a travel cot. We were told cots weren't available, but we could have a 3rd bedroom for the baby. Not appropriate for a 24mth old!! However, upon arrival, there was a folded up travel cot in the hallway. It was a real squeeze to fit it in our bedroom (we had to push the bed upto the window) and once errected left us with 6inches of space on one side and about 18inches on the other (wall sockets stopped us moving it any further). At the foot of the bed there was a small wardrobe, but when you opened the doors, they almost touched the bed, so access real pain. The 2 non en-suite rooms in our appartment were the same - cramped.Our friends had the en-suite room but had the same complaints regarding a general lack of space. They had a TV in their wardrobe, but watching it mean closing the doors to walk around the bed! Worse still was the loaction of the toilet in the open plan bedroom / en-suite.... they had to keep the bedroom blinds down to avoid people walking past the window seeing in!!!Ah, the bedroom blinds.... they're utterly useless and block no light whatsoever. If you're easily disturbed by light in the morning, make sure you take an eye mask as the blinds don't block any light at all.I think the issue with the bedrooms is the layout and the mock private courtyard / water feature arrangement our appartment had. It squashed up all the bedrooms, but added no value to the say. At the end of the mock courtyard was a small private plunge pool, which was murky and cold due to being completely enclosed and getting little to no direct sunlight. Pointless.The living room area was big, but the furnishings were cheap and sparse. The tiny TV mounted high up on the big wall was particularly annoying and with only one sofa and 2 utterly horrible, cheap chairs to sit on, there wasn't enough comfortable seating for the 4 adults.... it'd be really annoying if you had 6 adults in the 3 bedrooms.Our patio had a bit of an ant infestation. When I reported this to the front desk on our way out for the day, the receptionist gave me a dirty look and a can of Raid!! When I suggested that as the guest this wasn't really my department, she huffed and said she'd sort it (she did). Not the sort of attitude I expect when finding an insect infestation in a hotel.In 4 days at the hotel, our room wasn't cleaned once, which was a surprise.... apparently this is policy. Odd.Oh and if you want a pool towel, you have to pay for it.... we just took the bathroom towels out there.The hotel is miles from the town and there's nothing to do within walking distance. You need a car or lots of taxis. We knew this but were seduced by the pool when booking.... as we had a hire car, the location wasn't an issue for us, but it might be for others.Finally and WORST OF ALL, upon check out they charged us $30 for use of the travel cot!!! After telling us they didn't have any and making us pay an extra $250 for an extra bedroom we neither wanted or used, they gave us the cot we asked for in the first place and charged us more money!! I've never been charged for a travel cot in all the hotels we've visited with the baby (about 10-12 in the last 2yrs.... we travel a fair bit), let alone charged for the cot AND another room, OUTRAGOUS. We're currently trying to pursue the hotel for a refund, but they don't seem to care.Unfortunately the good pool isn't enough to redeem this hotel. The service is terrible, we feel genuinely ripped off and the management team aren't bothered. The layout / cheap furnishings let the rooms down quite a lot, as did the ant infestation. Unless other rooms are significantly better than ours and we were just unlucky, none of our group would recommend this hotel, at this price."}

The location of the hotel is good (right in the centre of the city), meaning that most places of interest are either within easy reach, or accessable via the trams / trains. Car access is a bit tricky thanks to the tram lines \u0026 one ways, but that's hardly a deal breaker.I paid extra for a superior suite, but wasn't overly impressed. The living room area was a good size, including a desk, sofa, chair, TV and fridge, although: decor was dated (plain damaged \u0026 scuffed walls, with a dark carpet) and had little to lift it (i.e. a lack of mirrors or pictures).The bedroom was very small and was dominated by the bed and small wardrobe. There was no room in the bedroom for a suitcase and the small TV on the wall wasn't comfortable to watch. The bed itself was very comfortable and the curtains blocked the light well.The bathroom was a good size, but the fixtures were old. The fan wouldn't switch off and was quite noisy / annoying when trying to sleep.The hotel provided a travel cot for our baby as requested (big thumbs up there), but because the bedroom was so small, she had to sleep in the living room which wasn't ideal.The hotel staff were good and allowed us to check in early, which was appreciated.For the price and having paid for an upgraded room I was expecting more from the hotel. However, it provided a comfortable bed and aside from the bathroom fan, it was quiet. A decent hotel, but nothing about it stood out to be honest."}

Not knowing the city, we wanted to be sure that our accomodation was at least perect.... and it pretty much was.The staff were great throughout our stay and the room itself was huge. With a living / dining room containing a comfy suite \u0026 flat screen TV, fully setup kitchen, main bathroom, bedroom (again with flat screen TV) and en-suite, it was absolutely all we needed for our 3 night stay.The room was always well cleaned and while not the last word in modern decor, it was still well presented, comfortably and relaxing.Travelling with a baby, we made good use of the fridge, microwave \u0026 kettle in the kitchen. Coffee was topped up daily too.The only downsides to the hotel are the location. The main roads (Albert / Bay) are busy and there's a bus stop outside the hotel which makes it a little noisy in the front facing rooms. Also, while only 10/15min from the Parliment buidlings, it takes a good 25/30mins to walk to Byward Market / Rideau St and the bulk of the shopping / nightlife / restaurants. That said, the restaurant attached to the hotel serves some brilliant food!All things considered it's a great hotel as long as you don't mind a bit of a walk to anything past Parliment."}

While we weren't fussed about the fitted kitchen or our short trip, I'm sure it'd be a great bonus if you were there skiing for a longer duration.The hotel is located near the top of the awesome Mt Tremblant pedestrian village, which is jut about one of the nicest places we've ever been. My wife said: \"if Disney made ski resorts, this is what they'd build\"... and she's right, it's a fantastic place.We can't fault the hotel at all, it's a great place, we'd love to go back, maybe in the ski season.\n\n\nRoom Tip: We had a street facing room and even that was plenty quiet enough for us\nSee more room tips"}

It's located on the main square in Old Quebec, in the pedestrianised area (so it's nice and quiet at night). It has a lovely boutiquey feel and it's quirky design made us smile and feel comfortable. This was the only hotel on our trip that read our boking properly and provided a baby cot for us, so top marks there, too!The hotel falls down a little with some of those aspects that make it fun \u0026 quirky. The location is great, except there's nowhere to park your car, not even for loading / unloading. The car parks are a few streets away meaning a bit of a haul with your luggage, or you have to pay to park temporarily on the street, then move your car later. The rooms are really funky, but too small. With the baby travel cot in our \"Superior\" room, there was no room for our 2 suitcases. We had to re-organise the room to just have space for our luggage, not good. For the size and given it's lack of parking, I'd say this was a little over priced.It's a lovely hotel and if you didn't have a car or children, it'd be pretty much perfect. We really liked it but have to mark it down a point for it's size \u0026 lack of car parking.\n\n\nRoom Tip: If travelling with kids, you need to be sure they have a room big enough to accomodate you\nSee more room tips"}

We were expecting a luxury resort, where we could relax and unwind with all our needs catered for. This might sounds like a lot to expect, but we've experienced better resorts that truely do live upto the 5* rating.The resort is generally quite lively thanks to the large number of guests there. The main pool is always busy and can be quite noisy, thanks partly to the very loud outside stereo system. It's tricky to relax here.The main pool itself is fantastic and was generally very clean. The swim up bar is very busy and the staff just serve people randomly, so expect to have to fight for your drink. To be honest, this was the same in all bars and it seemed that the best way to get served was to be a pretty \u0026 lively girl, or wave money at them!That last point (money) was a big gripe of ours. Never on an AI trip have we seen so much tipping! The majority of American guests were literally throwing money at all of the staff for absolutely anything (glass of water, beer, cocktail, omlett, etc, etc!). It was very strange to see people litterally buying service. Many AI resorts operate a no tipping policy these days to stop such behaviour and the Lady H certainly needs to think hard about this as it creates divide with the tippers served ahead of other guests.The food was very random. The buffet restaurants were usually pretty decent, although the food was repetative (breakfast buffet never changed at all). Some of the freshly \"show\" cooked food was enjoyable though.The Sports Bar really needs to look up the term! They have half a dozen or so TVs, few of which tend to show sport and when they do, it's just what you can get in your room anyway! They tend to just play music in there too. Their food is OK, but the games equipment is pretty well used. It's location also means it's very dingey in there.Regarding the a-la-cartes:The Steak House is average, most of the meats tend to be a bit fatty \u0026 chewy, certainly not the best cuts of the cow.The Mexican \u0026 Creole restaurants are both pretty good, no issues with these.The Asian served very bland food, as did the Indian. The dishes you'd order from your local take-away would blow these two restaurants out of the water.The Italian was poor. Pizzas are made with bought-in bases and are generally under cooked and very stodgy. The lasagne was terrible and loaded with salt.The Fish restaurant is good and we enjoyed many a lunch \u0026 evening meal in there... however, it does close regularly for weddings, so check it's operation before making your way over there.There are BBQs on the main beach \u0026 Sunset Cove beach which are good, altough you can queue for 3/4 hr at Sunset Cove. There is also a massive beach BBQ on Friday nights at the main pool which was very well done.Sunset Cove beach is great, but busy, so you can struggle to get loungers / shade. While on the subject of loungers, people leave towels on them all the time to reserve them - this isn't allowed, so if you don't see any belongings with the towels (clothes, bags, etc), just chuck the towels off and take them.The spa is very nice and definately one of the high points of the resort. However, as it costs quite a bit (the pools / sauna / gym are free tho') to have a treatment, it should be. We had a few treaments and enjoyed it very much.The entertainment is hit \u0026 miss. The same people work the pool area during the day, before working in the theatre at night. They work hard but their routines in the evening are always the same and generally uncoordinated. After they've done their bit (approx 9:30pm), the main entertainers come on. Some of these guys were very good, but others (the dance groups especially) were very poor. The upstairs entertainment (generally bands) were usually a lot better.The rooms are 3* only and as this is your home for 7-14 days, make a big impression on your perception. The bathrooms were good (whirlpool baths \u0026 big showers), but the hot water ran out regularly and on a couple of occasions, we had no running water at all!!! The beds were relatively comfortable and usually clean, but the sofa in our room was badly stained. TV channels were limited and often some of them cut-out. Once we had no clean towels delivered, but generally our maid did a decent job. I think we were lucky here as a few guests complained that they would not get maid service for a few days at a time. Partly because of the mini gardens in the middle of each villa, there are a lot of critters out when the sun goes down. This makes is very noisy at night and difficult to sleep if you're a light sleeper.The staff were random. Often we were completly ignored, not even getting acknowledgements while being served or thanking them, while others were attentive \u0026 polite. You really didn't know what you were going to get. Disappointingly, they would often barge past you, never saying excuse me, or letting you thru' with your plate of food (in the buffets). This is not 5* staff behaviour, infact, some of the staff were quite rude at times.Be careful when booking excursions. Some people weren't told about extras they'd have to pay while on the excursion (e.g. food!) and you will be hounded by all the locals for money. We were openly asked for \"big tips\" and refered to as \"rich\" on more than one occasion. Tour busses will often drop you off at a mini-mall under the pretext that they need to re-fuel and they're not allowed to have passengers on board when they do. This is utter rubbish. Instead as the tours are run by locals, they're \"delivering\" tourists to their friend's shops so that you can be milked of more money. Not friendly at all. We never left the resort after this, as other guests said the same thing, having done other trips.We never went into the casino or nightclub, but feedback from other guests was that these were not worth visiting and were quite low rent.We had an OK time at the Lady H, but only after we accepted we weren't getting the 5* holiday we had booked \u0026 expected. We made the most of our time, searching out the quieter spots and generally relaxing peacefully.This is a very popular resort with North American holiday makers, there were very few europeans there during our stay. It's worth bearing this in mind as this could impact on your decision to stay at the Lady H.If you accept that it's only a 3* resort you'll be fine and I'm sure you'll have a good time. On that basis and if you get a good deal, I'd recommend it. However, if you're taken in by the pretty pics, 5* tag and size, you're going to be disappointed, so I'd suggest you go elsewhere. We wouldn't go back as it's not the resort we'd expected it to be at all."}

There was a bottleneck where tickets were checked then to board through one small door whilst those lucky enough to have an umbrella shock them dry and closed them. I was soaked to the skin. The free coffee ran out! There were many waterfalls to see as they were teeming down every rock face. There were sight of some Fur Seals and that was about it as visibility was non existent. It was a pity that we could not see much but as I said earlier you cannot legislate for the weather.

Some 5 - 6km up a road then severely narrowing road where you need to have your wits about you as there are oncoming vehicles, runners and walkers using the same piece of tarmac. I nearly confused myself part way up thinking the the cafe was the top due to its large sign, the summit is another two kilometres further. Having parked up, we were able to revel in the 360 degree panorama with views of the ocean, river and mountains in the distance. Anyone in the area who loves landscapes this is a must and it will not disappoint. We are glad that the urge to go was justified."}

He explained the history of the area including explosions of the early 20th Century. Having completed this part of the tour we were then driven to where there was a geyser. There were masses of people waiting in expection of an eruption, this finally came in the form of pouring a powder solution down the vent. This was not my idea of a natural phenomenon.

We were shown to our table and when everyone was assembled we were given a talk by one of the tribe. We did the touristy thing were someone was elected Chief (cheesy). The night consisted of the following: 1. Traipse down a glade to see some warriors row a Maori canoe up river for a photo shoot.2. Be shown how the food is prepared using ancient techniques.3. Cultural Show.4. Food5. Questions and answer session.6. Down into the forest (down paved tracks) to see either glow worms or other birds etc.7. Transport back to accommodation.I found the show to be a little on the long side, conducted in a leaky building so much so my wife had a soaking patch on her trousers.The meal was in my opinion a little dry as I do not like gravy etc. It was however full of flavour and plentiful. The Fish Chowder was extremely good. At the end of the meal we were escorted back into the jungle by a somewhat monotone lady although very knowledgeable to see glow worms, birds and reptiles, the highlight though was an encounter with the shy and nocturnal bird of New Zealand the brown Kiwi. It would appear that we had been booked for this extra and proved a bonus as we saw in I must admit poor light, both male and female birds.The upshot is that although personally I do not do culture, both my wife and I had an enjoyable evening. Make sure you add the Kiwi as you will regret to your dying day.o"}

The Kiwi 360 is no longer owned by this company, it was lost when the owner sold out. The shop is housed in a small barn type building with little stock yet to had as everything seems to have been put on hold for the holiday period. We paid NZ$18 (seniors) for a tour round the Orchard. The guide was very knowledgeable about all aspects of the fruit from propagation to dispatch throughout the world. We were taken into the vines (not trees) and had the techniques described to us. You tour is made in an electric buggie. Back at the shop we were treated to a shot of Kiwi juice, dried Kiwi, fresh Kiwi and Kiwi Jam. I would think that it will take at least 6 months to be fully up and running, but only if people continue to visit, that way by next summer (NZ that is) it will be Avery good place to spend an hour or two."}

The Pizza was of the thin crust variety the size of a dinner plate. My wife thoroughly enjoyed it. My chicken (half bird) looked appetising but on splitting the leg from the breast it was patently obvious that the thigh had not been totally cooked through. The breast was moist and succulent. I pointed this out to the waitress who was horrified and having apologised disappeared with the offending item. I was offered a replacement which I declined as I had eaten enough. In the end they deducted the cost of the meal though I was happy to pay, my only concern. Was for the diner would had the other half.

Notwithstanding this it was excellent.Main courses were: Two snitzels, one Whole Sea Bream and lastly the Sea Bass with Prawns. Our wives said that their Snitzels were tender and tasty, my friend said that his Bream was fiddly although was succulent and full of flavour. My Bass was very good, however, they should no use the plural on their menu when I was presented with only one butterflied prawn giving the appearance of two! Three desserts were ordered, my wife ordered the Eton Mess which when presented cleared was enough for two people, we ordered another spoon and she was helped to finish it.

They allowed us to decorate the table and pitch balloons whilst they kindly looked after the cake. There were 6 adults and 3 children there. The staff were very attentive bringing drinks and food even though the place was packed they never ignored us once. The food was excellent, my Sea Bass with Salmon in a Crayfish sauce was exquisite. The cake in the shape of our niece's handbag stole the show. Thank you to all the staff at the Exchequer who made it such a memorable evening."}

We were shown to a table next to a rather noisy and large group of people who were just having their order taken which meant there was a likelihood of a long wait as the food is cooked fresh to order. This turned out to be correct as it was almost half an hour before our food arrived. The food when it arrived was very hot and tasty, my wife had the haddock whilst I plumped for a large cod. Although it looked substantial on the plate, it was more batter than fish, crispy though it was. Nonetheless, we both left sated and full. Will visit again."}

We selected this hotel as it is located roughly between my daughters home in Aberdeenshire and our home and were were collecting my granddaughter and her belongings. We had booked three rooms all of which were excellent. Booking in was a breeze and we were swiftly in our rooms. We ate at the adjoining Brewers Fayre (see separate report). My only gripe was the parking, as a disabled driver, I found the two disabled bays poorly marked and in the end had three cars parked on without a blue badge. The other parking problem we encountered was that it is used as a free parking area for local supporters of the towns football club to the detriment of visitors. All in all it was a pleasant overnight stop. Finally, I would like to thank their staff for taking time out to visit the post office to return my wife's E - Reader which she left behind."}

This time it was lunch with ex work colleagues. We all went for main and dessert option. One ordered the snitzel and two of us had the stuffed chicken breast. My chicken breast was slightly over cooked meaning that the thinner part of the fillet was dry, but in the main it was more than edible. What appears to be a small portion on the plate is deceiving as having eaten the contents I appeared slightly full, only having just enough room the the Oreo Cheesecake which melted in the mouth. If I have one criticism regarding the establishment is the the delivery of food is slow but well worth waiting for, which enabled good chin wag catching up on old times. Will I return? You bet I will, already booked over the Christmas period."}

Food choices in the breakfast buffet is not that plenty but most of them is luscious and fresh, old man who's in charge of welcoming and counting the guest is very polite and professional assisted us throughout the breakfast. Aircon in the room is evenly cooled, I wish they have a duvet blanket for the beds, which most of the hotel does already. Room amenities is also provided. Good free wifi connection. Lobby ambiance is outstanding Swimming pool is superb but i did not notice if there is available life guard for security and safety purposes.

Could it be that they serve their meals at tables in a cardboard tray with plastic knives \u0026 forks! Indeed everything is of the throwaway variety. The Haddock (if that's what it was (lacked any taste)), the puffed up batter disguised the small amount of fish there was inside. I would suggest that the proprietor tries to eat flaky fish with bendy plastic utensils. Thankfully, I will not be visiting Chester in the near future so will not have to endure such a poor meal in this establishment."}

However, what they failed to say that there are another 40 rooms for the naturists and over 200 butler service rooms elsewhere in the complex all using the same facilities, therefore Thomson are being economical with the truth.( I now note that they have changed their web details). We arrived late afternoon after an hour and a half from the chaos that is Cancun Airport. After a quick briefing and issuing of keys we are taken to our rooms by buggy.We have been allocated an upstairs room (only 2 floors) facing the sea, It is a well-appointed room, inside the room door to the right was a separate toilet with a bizarre system of automatic light that stayed on for an age even having shut the door, the shower was in a cubicle and was excellent, facing these were two sinks with hair dryer, power for shavers and a reversible shaving mirror. To the left of the entrance is ample closet space. The room was split into a piece of furniture containing a safe, fridge and coffee making facilities and a set of drawers. Opposite was a huge bed (big enough to ignore your partner after a row and also with sheets that were too small!) down a small step there was a settee and coffee table and opposite was a large Jacuzzi bath. Then a small narrow veranda through a sliding door and screen. My one criticism regarding the room was how dark it, needed lights 24 hours a day, one wall was a deep shade of Red, also the light bulbs were of a very low wattage.The walls and floors are paper thin; we had noise from below at 11.35pm made by them using their bath. All seating throughout the resort was very low indeed. All rooms are allocated a Concierge who were excellent, on day two they arranged higher chairs for the veranda and extra coat hangers, they also arranged for only drinks we wanted were in the fridge taking away others not required.As with other resorts they have a policy of none- reserving of pool and beach beds, if unused for over an hour belongings will be removed, all beds have a notice to that effect. Ignored by guests and staff alike. Why bother? There are loungers, beds and Bali beds; it was worth getting up in the dark to bag one. There is also a waitress service for drinks and snacks from around 10am until 4ish. Also the sea is quite shallow and ideal for non swimmers who just want to cool off.The resort, in my opinion, has too many restaurants.Meals can be taken in the following places without booking:Breakfast Lunch DinnerBeach Barbeque Beach BarbequeSandwicherie SandwicherieArricifes Restaurant Arricifes Restaurant Arricifes Restaurant Cullinarium Restaurant Cullinarium RestaurantSeafood Market Seafood MarketThere are also speciality restaurants that require booking for evening meals.Gourmet Pub, La Carreta Restaurant, Mia Casa and Klay Talay.All breakfast have eggs to order (fried, Scrambled, Omelette and poached. The latter unobtainable at the SandwicherieBeach Barbeque and Sandwicherie are both ideal for lunch with the latter full between one oâclock \u0026 two, requiring a wait of up to half an hour. Perhaps more tables could be added to reduce the wait even if that meant closing the Arricifes Restaurant.Arricifes Restaurant is a disaster, waited almost half an hour for eggs Benedict only to have it delivered with hard eggs and the hollandaise sauce a congealed mass on top. Lunch and dinner were little better, fruit is displayed in between hot food and not with the Petite Fours. Meat is only cooked on a flat top with only the chicken edible (do not expect Coq Au Vin or the like that have some moisture).Cullinarium is waiter service and the meals are well cooked in a pleasant atmosphere, why this is not classed with the specialist restaurants is a mystery.Seafood Market for breakfast, we found the best, it has plenty of choice and I would recommend it even if it is a walk away or buggy ride. Dinner meats are the same i.e. Hotplate cooked only although the salad selection is very good.The four specialist restaurants in the main are more style over substance.Gourmet Pub â Good place to start although they got the birthday wrong serenading me instead of my wife (embarrassing).Mia Casa â Again good food but small portions.Klay Talay â Without doubt the best, large portions, left there full and well looked after by Nelson, we enjoyed it so much we returned the following night.The bars bizarrely surrounded by swings are open for long periods of time and the staff remembered what your tipple of choice was (nice touch). What I would recommend would be a rail around the bars so that oneâs feet are not left dangling in space, which after a time is quite uncomfortable.We only attended one nightâs entertainment in Piccadilly Circus, a magician, who was first class and if performing whilst you are there, I urge you to go.Finally, some last thoughts, the free WIFI is excellent, good enough to receive Skype and Facetime without buffering, there is little need to upgrade to their premium service. All furniture is extremely low and not suited to patrons with artificial joints. This is only a three star resort at best. It is saved by the wonderful staff whom will move heaven and earth to ensure your holiday goes well, they are always pleasant and never ignore you. You can be greeted by as many a ten people just walking to breakfast.\n\n\nRoom Tip: If Beach View, Go for upper floor\nSee more room tips"}

As we had time to spare before our trip we retired to their Cafe. We had two excellent coffees together with a very moist flapjack and a wonderful tea cake which was toasted to perfection. We boarded the barge for the trip having been given white plastic helmets (Is this another case of PC?) we pulled out and meandered through the many tunnels, watching slide shows. The barge captain gave a very good and informative talk throughout the voyage. Not too pricey. Well worth a visit."}

We arrived around 10.30 to find many cars already in the car park together with a host of buses. A quick coffee in the cafe and we were off down the road to look at buildings and shops we had see before plus all the new ones. We were wandering around when a member of staff informed us that he was shortly to give an exhibition of Brass Casting. We joined him to the rear of a row of houses in his workshop. He gave a very good talk and cast three items which when cooled were shown to the watching visitor. We then wandered down to the canal edge to look at many nautical paraphernalia. We continued to wander visiting the Women's Institute building before looking at the various shops. Our last port of call was the Chip Shop where we bought some pricey Fish \u0026 Chips the latter being undercooked although the Fish was moist and tasty. Having eaten we waited for a team to take us to the top of the site where there is an exhibition of cars, all in working order, we were told that they bring them out each month for a run about. We spent nearly six hours on the visit and enjoyed it immensely. Pricey to get in but gift aid you entrance fee you are entitled to free return for twelve month. Enjoy your visit."}

The Risotto was presented an a strange square plate with a depression in it. The fish \u0026 chips also came on a square plate. The chips numbered about ten, they were soggy and overly large and rustic (not fully peeled).

The service from the staff is and has always been excellent, There were just a few things this time that really were not up to the normal standards. Firstly the rooms are normally spotless, this time there was hair on the floor, in the shower and in the basin. The beds were a king size, now they are a double. The rooms have been redecorated and they look really nice, but things seem to have been minimized to give extra space. The space was perfect before. Breakfast was also a bit of a shambles, there were empty tables but we were told there was nowhere to sit except the bar stool counter. Then we were told where we were sitting was not clean, and then we were moved to a table. These are just the things that really made this less enjoyable than on previous visits. The service from all the staff remains outstanding. We were in room 419."}

There was no fridge in the room which was dissapointing. Breakfast the next morning was shambles. Breakfast stars at 6:30 we were there at 7:00 and staff were still busy setting up. No coffee or tea was offered, there were no glasses out to get juice. The selection on offer was very poor. We actually went and bought breakfast somewhere else. The lady who we assume was incharge saw us walk out two minutes after walking in and said nothing. When we checked out we told the guy at the front desk, he didn't seem to concerned with what we told him. We got the room at a great rate but even at greatly discounted rate, it was still to much to pay for such poor service."}

First let us start with the BIG THANK YOUS to the people that made it so special. In the main restaurant Mahen and his team really are a credit to ALL of Club Med. We were always warmly greeted and he always took the time to come over and have a conversation and make sure that we were looked after. On his team Suman and Thamih are the two guys that we saw the most. We always sat where they were working and they made sure that we were looked after from the time we walked in to the time we left for breakfast, lunch \u0026 dinner. Suman and Thamih made our last night , so special that it brought my wife to tears with the way in which they ended off our trip with our reserved table that was decorated beautifully. Also a big thank you to Munsif whom we only got to know the last few days.  When we arrived we were welcomed by Patrice, who gave us a quick orientation of the island before taking us to Over Water Bungalow for our 7 nights. He always took the time to see us when he was around. Vichy another star for Club Med, overseeing the Manta team always came over for a chat or for a drink at the bar, he always made sure he came over whenever he spotted us. The GOâs Chihiro was excellent as was Simone. Barque the Chief of the Village would also come by with a warm greeting whether it be on the beach or at the restaurant.  In the Manta lounge the two barmen Dileep and Al were always friendly and on had just about all day / night for whatever beverage you would require. Nadham at the Uru bar was also very friendly and helpful. The Manta lounge was great for just a quiet drink or to sit outside and admire the view.  If you can we would advise anyone to spend at least a night in the Bungalows, they really are stunning. We were lucky to have 7 nights, they are really outstanding. One the water where you can just fall into the warm blue sea. The stunning views from your bed, private deck, and bath tub. Just some minor issues with them though. They are all in need of a serious refurbishment. The aircon situation needs attention, I would hate to stay in them in Summer. The curtains were really dirty, and full of little holes. The cushions on the deck chairs are tired, and in some cases have holes in them. The mini bar, that we were told was restocked every day, was only stocked once in our entire stay, and even then it wasnât fully stocked. The food in the main restaurant was superb. There was something different every day, if you canât find something to eat here then you are a really picky eater. Everything from the fish, beef, lamb \u0026 pork was cooked superbly. The desserts were always delicious. You never had to go without because there was always more than enough, and you never had to wait long to get anything.  There are more than enough activities going on during the day if you are so inclined, or you can spend the entire day on the beach, and feel like you are the only ones there. You never feel like you are on a crowded beach somewhere.  The store is VERY VERY expensive. I would advise waiting for the night market, which is excellent if you want to pick up some reasonabley priced souveniers. The sea life just around the resort was amazing, all sorts of fish, black tip sharks and rays. You donât even need to go snorkelling to see anything. This really was a holiday to remember and somewhere we will definitely be going back to when we have the chance."}

After a tortures journey from Puerto Plata to Samana, we boarded a small boat for the journey across the bay to Cayo Levantado to be met a smiling entourage of staff. There ahead of us loomed a steep walk (small incline for the fit person) up from the Jetty to the main reception area. It was surprising how hilly the resort is as I have only been on flat Islands in the Maldives.We were transported to our beach villa by an electric buggy. Even though it was dark, the area was well lit and a stoneâs throw to the beach. We walked up a short path to a large terrace containing an outdoor Jacuzzi, two sunbeds, small table and two chairs. Entering the villa were confronted a relaxing area containing a three piece suite with footstools, glass topped table and TV on a table cum stand. Up a small step to the bedroom area which consisted of a canopied 6Â½ foot wide bed, bedside table with 3 drawers on either side. A desk area containing a fridge (refilled daily) more drawers, coffee/tea facilities and yet another TV! (neither used in 3 weeks) There was a spacious wardrobe with coat hangers, robe, ironing board, iron and safe. The bathroom was large, containing a whirlpool bath, two sinks and separate shower toilet and bidet.We were greeted by our Butler, Kelwin who explained all the controls etc. and asked what pillows and scented oil we required. There were two faults with the villa, first and most important was the lack of hot water in the morning, secondly, the lighting my lamps and standard lamps were inadequate for the height of the room, some down lighting from the ceiling would suffice.The weather in general was good although we did encounter one or two heavy rainfalls and high seas, the first of which deposited the beach onto the road and garden turning our beach villa by the sea into one on the beach! I took almost 3 weeks to rectify the situation fully.There are 5 restaurants available, 4 of which require reservations.The main buffet restaurant is located in the main building and offers inside and outside dining. It has a theme every evening and you are greeted at the door with a cocktail of the night and a hand sanitiser (as in all restaurants) Thursday is Their Gala Night with a display of Seafood second to none. It is also the main breakfast and lunch place to eat.The other four are âspecialityâ and are listed as:Rodizio: A Brazilian style restaurant specialising in different meats presented at the table on swords. Starter is a self-service salad bar (donât go mad, leave room for the meat). There was a sizzling platter of vegetables to accompany the meat. They only stop coming by showing a red card. There is also a sweet (for those who have left room!) Don Pablo: This is a small steak house stuck away in a corner of the resort making it intimate for special occasions. We had Crab Soup served at the table from a teapot severing vessel which was a little strong and grainy in texture, Steak for my wife was tender and my Salmon and Lobster Cannelloni was excellent. No sweet as I was presented with a birthday cake with the waiting staff giving a rendition of Happy Birthday and made to wear a silly hat (thankfully my wifeâs phone didnât take a good photo.Portofino: Their Italian Restaurant and in my opinion the least liked, we started by eating each otherâs starter as they were placed in front of us incorrectly and we had forgotten due to the delay between ordering and receiving. My wife had pork fillet on apple puree and nothing else, I had Ossobusso Beef Cannelloni. The beef had been shredded but they had left in the cartilage making it very unpleasant.Mediterraneo Restaurant: This in our opinion was the best of specialist restaurants and we visited on three occasions. All meals were a delight, its menu like all the others were small in choice but a delight to the palate. All restaurants require gentlemen to have long trousers and shirts with the exception of the buffet were (Gala Night being an exception) although I did not see anyone failing to be admitted if they did not comply.Lunch could also be taken in the Portofino, Mediterraneo area by the beach side pool.There are bars in the main lobby, terrace in the evening and down on the beach.Finally the staff, what can I say, they are by far some of the best I have encountered, each wearing a smiley badge to go with their smiling faces. They could not do enough for us and I shall miss them. Special mention to Maria who lighten my life each day with the broadest smile of all from such a petite girl.I would return to this resort in a trice were it not for the arduous journey from Puerto Plata to Samana (Thomson travellers only)\n\n\nRoom Tip: Try the expensive Beach Villas - But not 31007 to 31009\nSee more room tips"}

We were briefed about the hotel by one of the welcoming staff.We were then taken to our room (an upgrade to Junior Suite) which overlooked the swim up pool below. The room was spacious and well-appointed splitting the living area into two by means of a set of drawers. The toilet, sink and shower were all in the separate. We had a balcony containing a table and two chairs to which we had a sun lounger added(Delivered within minutes of our request) (not available in a standard room due to lack of room).There are two Al A Carte restaurants in addition to the main Buffet restaurant situated close to the pool. The food in general was very âsameyâ although well cooked and prepared. Visitors are allowed a free Al A Carte per week which must be booked in advance (preferably 2 days). I cannot comment on the standard as we did not eat there due to late request for a table.Breakfast catered for both the British palate i.e. hot cooked food with eggs cooked to order and the continental of cold meats, Cheese and fruits. Cereals and large selection of yogurts were also available, One item not to be missed is the honeycomb with is presented in a frame and was delightful. Lunch consisted of Cold and hot dishes as did dinner, both meals also had an array of wonderful deserts which were difficult to ignore. Meals can be taken on the terrace alongside the restaurant or within its air-conditioned walls.There was also Ice Cream and cakes available in the afternoon. They had three themed dinner nights each week we were there, namely, Monday â Turkish Night, Wednesday â Far East Cuisine and Friday Night was Mediterranean Night (not that I could see much difference in the food choices.In general, the food was of a high class.The in house WIFI (free) was of a very high standard and one of the best that I have encountered on my many travels.There are Bars scattered throughout the hotel, the pool bar is open from 10am until 11.30pm, the lobby bar opens at 6.00pm and the rooftop terrace bar is open most of the day on a self-service until the late afternoon when bar staff take over. There is also a supply of soft drinks at the beach by the lifeguard station. Drinks are dispensed by waiters around the pool. Water and beer is also available in our room and replaced daily (Other drinks can be purchased and added to the fridge).The entertainment is very low key with no pressure placed on guests to compete or attend. We had a wonderful fortnight with very hot weather with the exception of the last couple of days when the heavens opened and we were deluged in thunderstorms, stopping in explicably for meals. The staff throughout the hotel were excellent, from the smiling receptionist to the cleaners, special mention to Ihsan, one of the restaurant waiters who was brilliant finding a table when we wanted one.The Old town of Side can be reached by walking the promenade past all the hotels, it took us almost an hour, but is easily reach in half the time if one is more mobile than we are. It has a small harbour and Roman ruins together with many shops selling the usual and sometime genuine fake clothing and watches etc.I would recommend this hotel if you want a quiet break from children.I would have given this hotel a full 5 star but was let down with Room Cleaning timing. This was sorted in the end hench the 4.75 out of 5"}

We were collected 8.15am in a rather small and uncomfortable bus together with another 6 passengers, 4 others failed to show. We were taken to a meeting point where several other vehicles were waiting for us. Having filled the bus with passengers we headed for the mountains. Another hour plus past before arriving at what would be our lunch stop to transfer to Off Road Vehicles. We were given a short briefing and split into small groups and headed up into the mountains in Convoy. We stopped at two places of magnificent scenery before returning for lunch. This consisted of trout in vine leaves or a spicy chicken dish together with salad, dry bread, an apple and a drink of choice. The afternoon consisted of a repeat of the morning albeit to different spots including a short excursion off road. Back to the lunch stop for a video of our day (were able to buy an expensive copy!) and a plea for tips from the driver!We were then split into different groups for our 1Â½ hour return drive, arriving at approx. 5.15pm. We were promised the following when booking: 1. Air-conditioned transport throughout.2. A hearty out-door barbeque.3. An English speaking guide throughout.Non were forthcoming, fortunately, I was asked by the Rep to precis the trip to enable her to brief further tourists, which I duly did and was given a full refund as we had not received what had been promised.All in all, it was a really long journey for a mediocre lunch and four vistas and was highly expensive for what you received. I could not in all truth recommend this trip."}

At 1.00pm we retired to the conservatory for lunch. As we were a small party of three we were shown to a table that was neither in nor out of the room due to it being fully booked and as such there was a constant flow of patrons and staff passing the table. That said, the meal was excellent and plentiful. Two of us had the home made Chicken and Sweet Pepper pie that melted in the mouth. A dessert was out of the question as I was full.

On arrival, we confirm our suitcases and are taken through the cavernous lobby to the Ball Room with the other arrivals. We are given cold refreshing towels and a drink and asked to fill in a form whilst they check or passports. We are then given a quick briefing about the hotel and given room keys, an ID card (no arm bands here) and towel cards. Our room was airy clean and spacious with one of the biggest beds I have seen, it must be at least 7 foot. Large Bathroom with walk-in shower (no bath).The pool beds tended to go early but there are plenty of beds on the beach. The swimming area is roped off although I did experience a clown in a catamaran who didnât seem to know which way to go when starting off fouling his rudder with the rope.The Terrace (above the upper pool) is ideal for pre-dinner drinks and near nightly entertainment (singers and musicians).Eating: There are a few places that one can eat.Breakfast is served in the main restaurant (La Coupole) between 7 and 10.30am it also caters for Lunch 12.30 â 3.00pm and Dinner 6.30 â 9.30pm. All Meals are Buffet.Blue Marine Restaurant serves dinner from 6.30 â 9.30pm, again buffet; this is located near the beach.There is a beach bar open from 10.00am â 5.00pm serving late breakfast from 10.30 â 11.30am and snacks between 12.00 â 4.00pm.There are also speciality Restaurants that require 24 hour advance booking, these are La Toscana (Italian) and Ali Baba, both these attract an extra charge. We ate in all restaurants with the exception of Ali Baba and found the food both plentiful and appetising. Watch out for the desserts or your waistline will increase.Bars: There are bars by the top pool, off the main reception, the beach bar all serving decent beers and soft drinks etc. in most places there is also waiter service.My wife celebrated her birthday whilst there and was sent a cream cake and card to our room which I thought was a nice touch.There is nightly entertainment either on the terrace or the Arena which is situated below the La Coupole Restaurant where we had evenings of Belly dancing, Acrobats and Fire and Dance.The Staff were excellent and couldnât be more helpful, everything they did was with a large smile.The hotel is situated quite close to the Old Town and is easily reachable on foot. Donât bother with the guided tour (They visit 3 pre-arranged shops!) it is more fun just wandering around on your own. The shopkeepers will ask you to visit their shop but are not offended or pushy if you decline.We had a thoroughly excellent holiday and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to visit Egypt; in fact, we are breaking our habit of only visiting an establishment once by returning once more next year. It is one of the best if not the best hotel we have ever visited.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Try for the lower end of Block containing rooms 2225 etc. (sun in the morning)\nSee more room tips"}

We arrived to find a large complex consisting of a cavernous restaurant, tequila factory/outlet, shop (cannot avoid, only way in is through the shop) and a small unit \"Don Tadeo\" turning out small silver and gold jewellery using Mayan symbols, touristic I know but somewhat unique. In the restaurant groups were allocated a set of tables drinks are brought to the table (one free only) and the food is buffet style. The food is non spicy and hot. There are local dancers periodically dance through the restaurant and have their tip bowls waiting at the exits, the waiters however are more forthcoming, placing bowls on the tables. Having lunched we ventured toward the Cenote itself, passing changing and showering facilities. We had to walk down a very steep staircase, passed the \"photo op\" with pseudo Mayan Indians to a natural platform where one could take in the sight of a small lake and an even smaller opening to the sky in the roof from which a constant cascade of water fell into the water below. It appeared that is was permitted to jump the 10 feet or so into the water away from the other bathers. The can be seen small fish swimming around the bathers, how they got there is any-ones guess.My tip: If you are unsure whether you will swim or not, change before descending as to do the flight more than once would be arduous."}

It has a few sunbeds for hire on the small sandy beach. We had a lunch of club sandwich and a drink whilst watching the sea roll in and children playing in the water. The afore mentioned sandwich was packed with egg, cheese, lettuce, meat etc. and came with substantial fries. The total cost for two was 230 pesos (approx. Â£11.50). I would recommend that if visiting the town you spend some of your time enjoying a snack and drink at the excellent waterside restaurant."}

Driving North from Playa Del Carmen you leave Highway 307 the Puerto Morelos exit, from Cancun travelling south take the first Retorno after the elevated section and again take the Morelos exit. Between 200 and 300 yards there is a small gate with a very small Jardin Botanico turn right and park in the car park. Cross the car park to the office to pay the entrance fee of 120 pesos (Â£6).You will be given a small map of the site to navigate your way round. Take plenty of water , insect repellent (we became blood donors for the day for thousands of Mosquitos) and sturdy footwear as the terrain is very uneven and is not suitable for the disabled. I would advise against visiting in November as it is their winter and there is little or no colour whatsoever. We heard the colony of Spider Monkey's but unfortunately we did not sight them, neither did we climb either of the tower, nor cross the rickerty walkway. If I ever visited this again I would ensure that it was in full bloom. The trip round the sight was quite arduous, navigating the various roots that litter the path."}

We were greeted at 5.45am (10 minutes late) by our guide Victor who together with the driver Manuel and a young girl whose name I have unfortunately forgotten. We quickly hit the road with a half empty bus only to pull over to await others that were being ferried from different hotels by minibus' We finally got underway at 6.30am for the long and somewhat boring journey to Chichen Itza, arriving some three hours later, we had been given drinks and food en-route. On arrival, the girl went to obtain the groups' tickets whilst Victor organised us in readiness to enter the site. We were given two entrance tickets? the first was torn in two and the other clipped and scanned!The sight of the big pyramid that greeted us was breath-taking as were the whole of the buildings that were visible. Victor then proceeded to take us round various buildings explaining the various aspects of Mayan life. It is quite evident the this must have been a vibrant city and it was easy to visualise this. We spent a good two hours roaming the site admiring the many structures that have been restored, one can only imagine how hard it must have been constructing this without the use of modern tools and equipment. Any one travelling to the Yucatan and not visiting this site will have missed an opportunity of a life time. Entrance fee for non tour visitors is 204 pesos (Â£10.00). One drawback are the many hawkers that litter the site. Go early and you will miss the crowds and the hawkers who will still be setting up."}

There was a lot of activity with boats and snorkelers aplenty ready to go out to the many reefs that lie off shore.

We left our base at Playa Del Carmen travelling south to Tulum, the road like most on the peninsula are straight as a die. We wrongly to the first signed road left into the area ignoring our sat nav (I know best). We were stopped by persons who explained that the road was closed ahead and we should park there, knowing that there was an official car park we push on past someone else trying the same trick and went approx. 150 - 200 yards turning right, we then espied the car park on the left. Note best access is to turn left off the 307 after the garage on the left having arrived at the area. The Car Park cost 75 pesos (around Â£4). There are plenty of shops selling the usual tourist dust harbourers. Join the queue for the road train ( a tractor pulling one or two \"carriages\") it cost 20 pesos one way and saves what was a longish walk to the entrance, I got on free as I had a walking stick (I had unfortunately had to pay for my able bodied wife!) There was quite a queue for entrance tickets which cost 59 pesos each (there appeared no concessions) Whilst queuing visitors are constantly asked if they wanted a guide which cost approx. 600 pesos an hours (cheap if a group). We entered the complex through a hole in the wall that surrounds the site. Beware of visitors and their cameras as this is a good place for a photograph. The complex is vast and all structures are roped off to visitors although some people thought that it didn't mean them as they went over ropes to take photos. Paths were dusty and uneven and there are plenty of ups and downs along the way. It gets very crowded, considering the size of the place you seem on top of each other. There is very little seating largely made up of either small tree stumps at a ridiculously low level or benches shaped from large rocks. If you follow the main track you find yourself outside before you have seen everywhere, Tip: look at the internal structures across the grass area before you visit the area that borders the sea. It is a very interesting site and well worth a visit"}

The major annoyance I had with this transfer was the request for tips by the courier for himself and the driver for doing there job (If they consider themselves under paid, they should look for something different).On arrival at the hotel we were separated from our fellow travellers and shown to an office to book in as we had upgraded to a junior suite and all the added privileges that came with it. There were no forms to fill out, we past our passports over and they did all the work asking only that I signed the form. Having completed all the formalities we were personally escorted to our room by a delightful young lady who informed us what was available to us and where thing were.The room was large with a separate area containing a sofa bed and armchair together with a bookcase type of furniture with coffee machine and ingredients. The other room was dominated by a very large bed (could accommodate at least four) and a writing desk with a flat screen TV (this should be opposite the sofa not the bed).The bathroom was split into two parts, firstly you entered an area containing just a sink then through the frosted glass door was the toilet and walk in shower. As we occupied a ground floor room (thankfully, as the lift to the upper two floors did not work for the entire 3 weeks we were there) so we has a small terrace containing a small table and two chairs (were uncomfortable if sat on for a long period of time. The room contained a usable safe and a fridge that was restocked daily at no cost, and you are able to ask for only your own favourites to be in there excluding the ones cluttering and unused. The ceiling was paper thin and we could hear every bump and scrape from the room above, and the walkway could be noisy with inconsiderate people talking or shouting (not helped by the space between the floor and the bottom of the door. The robes that were on offer were much too small and considering that there were a number of rotund guests perhaps they need to order some larger ones. So, nearly top marks to the room, it missed in my opinion needed a chest of drawers and could have done with loungers outside as there were with rooms round the corner. There is free WiFi throughout the hotel and can be accessed on the beach if that is what you want. In general it worked well and had a good capacity. It did however break down once for a period of 20 hours, I went to reception and the conversation went thus: Me: What is wrong with the WiFi? Receptionist: It's not working! Me: When will it be fixed? Receptionist: Don't know, problem solved then!Privilege guests had the use of a lounge (next to the La Dolce Vita) that served excellent breakfasts and was available until 5pm each day, They also have an exclusive part of the beach where they enjoy waitress service although this can be rather slow if she has a large order to fulfil (don't order coffee, it's tepid when it arrives).The grounds are very well maintained and pleasant to look at and to enjoy the many species of birds and animals that wander through, generally, unbothered by guests. We saw many during our stay. They were as follows:Deer (Two that became three during our visit)Coati(mundi) (a member of the Racoon family)RacoonsAgouti Iguanasmall lizardsSquirrelThe bird species are too numerous to mention plus I couldn't name them either.The evening entertainment is varied with singers, dancers, pianist, saxophonist, magician to quote but a few. The highlight for us were a group of three singers called El Divos who treated us to some ballads and aria's.All staff seemed to have a permanent smile on their faces always happy to see you. Our two main waiters were Alberto in the La Hacienda and Alfredo in both the La Hacienda and the Privilege lounge were excellent and couldn't do enough for you, remembering your likes and dislikes even in a sea of faces, thank you to you both. My final thanks go to Alisandra down in the Privilege lounge, she was a diamond, nothing was too much trouble booking us into the various restaurants (Privilege guests have preference and do not have to queue) She remembered our names from day one and made our holiday something special giving advice on on all things Mexican.Restaurants:La Hacienda: This is the general buffet restaurant used for all meals. Breakfast tended to be the best meal of the day, with plenty of variety catering for all tastes be they British, American or Continental.Lunch and Dinner food was tepid at best and in general looked unappetising. Soups were always good and hot in contrast to the other fare. The bread was phenomenal.The following need to be addressed to improve this facility:1. Let guests seat themselves - will save long queues on entry. There are long queues between 8 - 9.30am.2. Have someone to oversee that plates etc. are in plentiful supply and why oh why are they all cold? have they not heard of plate heaters (the only time they were hot is when a new batch straight from the dishwasher had hurriedly replaced the empty shelf).3. Have someone checking whether food varieties are running short.4. Label the sweets (desserts) and Ice cream varieties.El Charro: Mexican Fare.This restaurant serves a dual purpose, being a snack bar and lunch outlet for the pool area.The evening menu is limited to a few starter, main course and dessert.The first visit was OK. We were given a Mango Margarita as a welcome drink together with a plate of tortilla chips and three dips (spicy, mixed chopped tomatoes, cucumber etc. and guacamole). We both had tostades (finely chopped meat, cheese and tomatoes on tortilla chips)followed by a Mexican mixed grill and steak. both meals were so filling we past on desserts.Our second visit was somewhat different I plumped for a dish of tortillas filled with chicken covered by two different coloured sauces the first was green made from green tomatoes and celery and the second red one made from tomatoes and spices (left a tingling sensation on the lips. My wife had beef skewers that were so tough they were virtually inedible. Whilst eating my meal I felt something on my leg that I dismissed as the table cloth being blown onto it, I finally looked down and saw a very large Cockroach walking up and down. Having knocked it off, I then watched it scurry away under another guests table. Not wanting to cause alarm, I spoke quietly to our waiter and then to the restaurant manager who were apologetic and offered us something to right this, I declined as I only wanted it raising (in retrospect, I wish I had asked for one of their brightly coloured cloths). I only hope that the whole restaurant and kitchen gets fumigated.Our third and final visit saw us recognised from the incident on visit two. The meal was even worse than the last. My grill was not a patch on visit one, the pork and chicken were miniscule and dry and the small thin piece of beef was so tough I was unable to cut it. My wife's steak was appalling, question, How do you make Fillet Steak tough and inedible? When I expressed my views to the waiter he just laughed, I assume he thought I was joking. We did not visit again and would suggest diners ask about the cockroaches before dining.Blue Moon Restaurant (billed as romantic dining) It is the only restaurant that men are required to wear long trousers (can't men be romantic in shorts).Again it has a limited menu and the portions are small (need another meal after dining).given a welcome cocktail of the day prior to the meal. I must be really unromantic as I found the restaurant bland.La Dolce Vita - Italian themed restaurant.This in my view was the best of all the food outlets and one we frequented most even though it was the furthest away from our room.You we given their cocktail of the day made from sparkling wine, lemonade and a different flavoured syrup. It was also the best place to see racoons and the moon rising over the Caribbean Sea. It had the most extensive of all the menus on offer. They brought a mini loaf of warm Oregano flavoured bread to the table (take care, this is extremely addictive and can leave little room for the excellent starter, main course and dessert). All our meals were first class and I would recommend this restaurant to guests and is well worth the walk, it is also the most popular judging by the people waiting to be seated. All restaurants with the exception of La Hacienda are all on a first come first served basis except that Privilege guests (as I said earlier can usurp them)This is a very good all inclusive hotel that is spoilt by the poor La Hacienda (I would have rated the hotel a 4 otherwise) and I would be tempted to return should I return to Mexico again (that is when Cancun Airport drifts from the memory). Finally, the best part of this hotel is that it is child free having no one under the age of 18. the peace and quiet was bliss."}

When we finally got to the front of the queue we were met by a very brusque women who announced that we had 2 minutes to get to the restaurant before it shut for the night as no allowance is made to keep it open for late arrivals. She then said that she was required to retain our passports (for police purposes) to which I politely requested a copy in case they were lost. She took umbrage at this and fussed and faffed until a colleague filled in the necessary paperwork. We were then given the dreaded arm bands, a document showing the location of the bungalow and a set of keys. We struggled down a staircase, across by the pool, onto the main pathway, we plodded along dragging our cases until we found the path showing our bungalow number. Either I misheard her or she gave wrong information regarding the doors. I spent five minutes trying to get in by the front door, in the end I went to the patio doors and gained entrance to find that the front door was barred at the bottom. The layout of the bungalow consisted of a main living area, separate bathroom and bedroom and a kitchenette with a fridge and a hotplate together with a few plates, cutlery and cups and saucers. There was one little problem though, there were no pans nor a kettle so even had we wished to have a coffee we had no means of making one. We found the day before we left that all rooms should have been provided with a kettle!Having had a comparatively good night, I endured what can only be described as a tepid water shower, it would appear that hot water had either been used by rooms closer to the source of the heat or it does not reach rooms on the far edges of the resort. We found by trial and error that bathing around 5pm would guarantee freezing and skin stripping hot water alternately. In the end, we came to the conclusion that around 10pm was the best time.We made our way to breakfast to find dirty and cracked cups, cutlery and glasses, the plates although washed had not been dried properly. There was some improvement when they replaced a lot of the crockery, the cutlery and plates continued to be a problem for the rest of our stay.The food was very âsameyâ throughout our stay and was nowhere near four star quality, potatoes on occasion swam in fat, there were chips every lunch and dinner, it was impossible at times to actually to distinguish which type of meat it was either by look or taste. It is impossible to have a quiet dinner (I will explain later).The internet is free although if there are more than half a dozen or so online at the same time it is impossible to connect and you risk being thrown out if someone with a strong device logs on. I took to using it early morning when no one else was around when it worked excellently.The layout of the entertainment stage between the pool and the restaurant is definitely in the wrong place. At 8.30 every evening we had the entertainment team looking after the children with song and dance at high decibel with the same songs night after night and there is nowhere to escape it, the only difference being that they switched them around but always finished on the same one with parents joining them on stage. Dinner was ruined as were any after dinner drinks. It was less noisy down by the harbour having a quiet drink at T \u0026 Nâs cafÃ©.To get out of the complex, there is a side gate to which you are given a key, ours didnât work but we left with some other guests who opened it with their key. On return we had to pass the gate and walk further up the road to the main entrance. I approached the reception lady and said that the key was incorrect only to be told that it was the correct key (I knew it wasnât as I had compared it with the other guests key). She was adamant that it was right but still gave me another, I showed her the difference but she still insisted it was alright, It is obvious that a former guest had detached the gate key from the hotel key ring and placed on their own only to replace an incorrect one on departure.Housekeeping runs from 7.30am to 3.30pm each day except for Friday when there is no service (4 star?) we found our cleaner arrived anywhere between 10am and 3.34pm. They made beds generally tidied up gave the floor a cursory mop and were out within 10 minutes, at no time was the kitchenette sink touched, it had the same marks on the stainless steel from day two.There was a strong drain smell in the area of the room and was quite pronounced in the early morning, there appears to be a treatment plant close to rooms 1107 and 1109. It is not pleasant and should be addressed.I feel that this hotel caters more for the young family and the expense of the older guest and if you lack children go to somewhere else.This hotel masquerades as a four star when in truth it is a two star at best. I would not recommend it to anyone with a modicum of common sense.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Avoid rooms, 1089, 1092,1091,1111,1112 and rooms in close proximity as the smell at times can be hor...\nSee more room tips"}

It is located overlooking the harbour in a parade of shops and cafes. It is run in part by a lad from south of Birmingham who is most pleasant and can't do enough for you. We tended just to have drinks whilst watching the world go by. My wife had two varieties of smoothies which she declared excellent whilst I had a boring Coke light. The beer is served on chilled glasses out of their freezer. Their food is cafÃ© fare, Sandwiches cooked breakfast, burgers etc. all prepared fresh. Their WiFi is free and of a good standard and the view of the harbour is good with plenty of Ferry and boat movements. I would recommend this CafÃ©."}

The show was lively and not too loud. The lead girl appeared weak set against other female characters in the first half although she greatly improved after the break, I can only put this down to the songs she sang, they suited her better as the show progressed. The audience was of an older age group, no doubt due the the songs involved. The theatre appeared to be only half full which was a shame as it was excellently performed. I would suggest that the sixties teens go and see it if it is playing in their area."}

The breakfast was great, with a great selection of cereals, pastries, coffee and juices.We had a few issues that were a bit irritating. We were in a room on the ground floor and we had some inconsiderate moron in the room above us stomping around at all hours of the night. We did speak to the front desk who told them to keep it down,and did offer us another room to sleep in, but it was just the inconvenience of some other persons lack of decency. Also the windows are not sound proofed, so the noise from Cars and Motorbikes racing around can get a bit much to. The lobby is sound proofed, so maybe and idea to do that to the rooms as well.

After reading some not so kind reviews we were a little worried about what to expect, but we need not have worried as everything was near perfect. We did the online check in before arriving so when we arrived we just breezed through the check in process. The magic bands are awesome, and the fact you can use them to pay for just about anything on the Disney grounds is a great innovation. We had a great room, second floor in the Calypso building. So we were close to the transport and the food court. We had made the request online to be close to these buildings and our request was granted. The room was more than big enough for us and our bags. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was large. The in room fridge was great for keeping water and drinks. The refillable mugs are must and pay for themselves if you are there for longer than 4 days. The food court was great to have so close by. It has plenty seating and we never waited long to be served. We only ate a few meals there but the service was very good and the portions were large, and the prices matched up to most other places in the area. The Maestro Mickeys store was great for not only souvenirs but for other little snacks and drinks if you didn't want to go and find a store. The transport ran smoothly and we never had to wait long for a bus from the resort or from any of the parks. We were always able to be at the parks well before opening time. The Wifi worked great in the room and on the grounds, we never had an issue.The only thing we can say that was inconsistent was housekeeping. It was not a major issue, but the room was cleaned very inconsistently. Some days seemed to entail more cleaning than others. Some days we would only have 2 towels, and other we would have 7. Some days they would throw out the empty shopping bags, and some days they wouldn't. This is a value resort, and it offers exactly that value. If you want more in room amenities or other little extras, go to one of the more expensive hotels. If you are out all day then this is perfect for you. If you want to save save money but still have that Disney service then this is the place."}

The bathroom is spacious, with a great big shower.The room comes with a cooker top, coffee machine, fridge and a microwave if you request one. Not to mention the utensils, so if you don't feel like eating out you can always have something in the room. The location is prime, it is just a few hundred meters from the heart of time square.

The breakfasts were everything that we enjoyed, and you don't have to pay extra for it which is not something that you get at many other NY hotels. Cereal, Fruit, Yogurt, Toast, Bagels, Oats, everything you need to start the day. That was one of our biggest reasons for choosing the French Quarters. The cleaning service can be a little slow, on a few days our room was not ready until after 3pm, but if you are out all day then that shouldn't really matter. The free wifi is also helpful.

We were allowed enough time at each place to see all that we wanted. It helped that the areas were not to busy so you didn't have to fight through the crowds. This is a must do for anyone that wants to experience those Christmas Lights."}

We decided to go this time and watch the Jets. While stadium itself is great, and the staff are all very helpful and friendly, i will never again go and watch the Jets. The people are unruly and just don't know how to behave in general. People are up and down all the time and walking in front of you so your view of the game is constantly blocked. How people that are clearly intoxicated are allowed to even find their seats is beyond me. But like i said that is my opinion, but the stadium and it's staff are all great."}

The food was good and the drinks were well priced. But the service was terrible. The waitress that first took our order spent more time eating and talking with other staff in the far corner. Our food was then brought out by another server who said that he would now be doing our table. Our original server just disappeared. The servers were not attentive at all, and were more interested in talking among themselves. We were never offered more drinks, never checked on nothing! For New Years Eve, we had bought our tickets online for the VIP Mezzanine level, with an ear;y access state on the ticket for 7pm. The only reason we bought these tickets is because we were staying the hotel attached and associated with the hotel. We arrived on the mezzanine level after 7pm much to the surprise of the staff, who said that access was only from 8pm even though the ticket stated 7pm. So we returned to our room and went back to the mezzanine level after 8pm. When we walked in we were stopped and told that we had to go outside and join the line and then come upstairs. (why could they have not mentioned this the first time we were there) This seems STUPID as we specifically booked this so that we would not have to bundle up and go out in that cold weather. Hotel guest's should get preference regardless. So we got our coats and then went and joined the LONG line, even though we were supposed to have pre-entry tickets. Once inside the Mezzanine level was great, the music was good and the drinks were plentiful. But we never received any food as stated on the tickets, only to find out much later that the food was placed on tables on the lower level, yet this was never told to us. For the amount of money paid, this level of service is not what was expected. You could never say that the people who own the restaurant, actually own the hotel. Because the staff are completely opposite. We never went back to the restaurant because the staff were so poor. We ordered 2 pieces of cheesecake from Bourbon Street to be delivered to our room, after 1 hour we had to call back again and find out what the problem was. Only to be told \"sorry\" and the phone put done. Bourbon street is not a place that we will ever go back to, regardless of what anything else is like, SERVICE THAT BAD is not something that can be condoned."}

When we walked into the restaurant we saw a lot of empty tables, yet people are waiting outside. Also, none of these tables had reserved signs on them. We were then told that if we went to the bar that there was no wait and you could eat there if you wanted. We went to the bar and ordered a drink, then asked the bartender for a menu. 20 min later when our buzzer sounded, we were still waiting for a menu. We left and went and got a table rather. Our server was friendly and took our order. The food did take a little long to come out, but when it did it was really good. The Hard Rock is a great place to eat, menu seems to have changed as well. Not as much variety as they used to have? Just a pity that our second experience wasn't as good as our first."}

From there we began the narrow and winding climb up to the crown, it is a very steep. But really good to see the inside. At the top you have a stunning view looking across to NY. We got some really good pictures, and then began the even steeper climb back down. Once we were out we got a few things from the gift shop, which was not badly priced. Then took a walk around liberty island before the crowds arrived. We were back at Battery Park by 11:30, and the lines them were already really really long.

As it happened we were looking for accommodation recently and saw Palazzo had a special going or should I say Sun International did. So we booked for the two nights as we had not stayed at this particular hotel before. Now Iâm sure most peopleâs thinking is that if you book a 5 star hotel that you will receive 5 star service/accommodation. Even at their special rate. Well after been thoroughly starred at upon entering the hotel reception (not sure if were not dressed the part or are too young to be there) Our room was the most out dated 5 star room I have ever stayed in. If the complaints on âHello Peterâ are anything to go by they all read similar. If you get it for free or at a special rate expect to be given their worse rooms and the worse service. Most staff were friendly, cant say much for breakfast staff or receptionistâs. Breakfast was a joke first morning were not offered coffee/tea and no butter on tables, were seated at a table with one chair and told to wait only then to be moved to another table, complete rubbish.Second morning got the tea/coffee, butter andâ¦.. toast, we still thought she had the wrong table and told her, she tells us all tables get toast!!!!! (Just not every morning, was not mentioned) Also a highlight for Palazzo is to get the paper every morning, got that Friday but not Saturday, strangely on our way to breakfast we saw other rooms had one.If Palazzo want to see how a 5 star hotel is actually run, they should spend some time at the Oyster Box in Umhlanga, had the best week there in January. Something else, just because people donât necessarily look the part does not mean they canât afford to be there!!! If you want a nice hotel to stay at Monte Casino go to Sun Square, service is good, rooms very nice/clean and close to everything."}

We had a great sea facing room. The rooms were clean, and had everything you could possibly want. The staff really went the extra mile, in that knowing it was a birthday, they sent two beautifully decorated cupcakes to the room when we arrived. I had arranged a bouquet of flowers that arrived and really looked great. The room was turned down every night and the bed really well laid out. The high tea is a must for anyone staying there, or even just to go there for that, it is well worth the money. We had a curry buffet included in our rate, and that was excellent. There was a wide variety and everything tasted fantastic. Just two small issues, 1) At the 3 breakfasts that we went to we were never once offered tea or coffee, we had to ask for it each day. 2) The air cons in the room were hard to figure out and seemed to switch themselves off at odd times, making the rooms rather warm. 3) On one of the days we returned to the room and found nothing to be working, only to discover that housekeeping had removed the room key from the holder that powers everything. Other than that we had a fantastic time, and the service from all the staff was amazing."}

This was a major disappointment from our first visit 2 years ago. Our check in process was SLOW. There was only one lady at reception, the other gentleman was off with what he said was his managers. How can the hotel manager leave guests waiting while staff show them around. The lady on reception was limited in the amount of English she could speak. Only when the other gentleman arrived back did our questions get answered. We had seen the pool access rooms on our last stay and wanted to stay in them this time, so we payed the extra amount of THB 1000 per night to be able to stay in this room. The one bed side was full of hair, the bathroom also had hair on the floor. We called the front desk who sent a manger who arrived promptly with housekeeping. We showed them the hair and after much apologizing we were told that the room would be deep cleaned the next day. Well that never happened the next day or on any of the other days of our stay. We wanted to use the beach towels provided but when we took them out the bag they were damp and had that mouldy smell on them and had holes. The linen in the room was OLD and yellow also full of holes. Bath towels were the same holey, frayed. After more days of an unclean room and a bath that you could not use because it had a massive leak in it. We again called the duty manager to our room. When we asked for some sort of refund on what we had paid for the room we are offered a better room upstairs. Now considering that you have to pay an extra THB 1000 per night for our current room, how is it that the other room is better. The handle for the patio door was DIRTY and did not look like it had been cleaned in months, and the door was broken to point where it was off its hinges. For the duration of our stay the door was never fixed, nor the handles cleaned. The actual patio was only cleaned once in our entire stay. The breakfast was a major disappointment, the range was not like it had been before. We ate the restaurant a few nights and the service from a FEW staff was excellent the rest were not up to standard, and the food was very good. The staff at the poolside bar were very inattentive, and hardly ever around. If you wanted anything you had to go and look for them as they were more often than not ducked behind the bar counter. It is sad to see how far this hotel has fallen in 2 years, considering all the hotels that are there and are been built you would think that Sea View would up its game. For those looking for a hotel in Patong, you can do allot better than Sea View. Despite asking to speak to the hotels Owner we were never given that chance despite promises that he would be phoning us."}

After reading reviews on trip advisor with regards to this hotel and seeing the pictures on the website it looked like this would be a great place to stay. Oh how wrong could we be. The only good thing about our stay at Beach Republic was hearing about the Sunday brunch, that we never got to go to. It seems like this is the only good thing going for Beach Republic. The check in process was slow as the front office staff had trouble speaking or understanding any English. When we did get to our room the bathroom was dirty, hair in the bath shower and floor. The rooms were not tended to by housekeeping in a timely manner. One day it was only made up at 3:30pm. The complementary tea and coffee was sometimes not replaced. The breakfasts were nothing like you are made to believe on the website. It is very limited in variety, and if you want any hot foods you need to order off a menu, and even then you are not guaranteed to get what you ordered. Or in some cases you order 3 items and it arrives on 3 different plates, and eggs arriving that were totally inedible If you want knives and forks you need to fetch your own. I had arranged for a massage on the beach for my wife and i, only to find that it was on the sand in the blazing sun with no shelter. When we complained i was told that it was something that they do not normally do. Well if you donât do it then say so, but donât charge for something if you canât do it properly. 5 meters down the beach was a place offering massages on the beach under shelter for half the price. I had arranged for a romantic dinner on the beach, and during the course of the day was in contact with the management who had moved the dinner indoors because of potential rain, we completely understand that. When we went down for dinner, no one knew who we were or what was going on. We were seated at a booth and given a standard menu. When we walked out, eventually it dawned on the hostesses as to what was going on. We were given a fantastic dinner in a great area well set up area, but it doesnât take away the lack of communication and organisation. It seemed blame was being passed from one person to the other. Baring in mind that all these extras are not free, and for the price that you are paying a member of the management team should be there making sure all is in order. The pool bar staff were attentive, well some of them. Other times you could wait for ages without being attended to. The daily happy hour was enjoyable. We raised our concerns with the residences manager (Julie Glover), who had every excuse under the sun for all the problems we had experienced. This is not a resort that we will EVER be going back to, and would not recommend this to anyone. If all that anyone talks about is the Sunday Brunch, by all means go there and have it, but think twice about staying there. Beach Republic is nothing like anything advertised on the website, or any pictures that you see anywhere, which could be seen as false advertising."}

On a previous trip to Bangkok we had been before to the Moon Bar, which led us to staying at the hotel now, and the Moon Bar was allot smaller than it was 2 years ago. The restaurant has been made larger and the bar smaller, yet there are more people at the bar than the restaurant. Which made it very cramped and the service a little slow.

After completing booking in procedures we are taken to our room on the third floor, the lift was just big enough for we two and our cases. The room was fairly large with a good size bathroom. Drawback in the bathroom was the height of the bath which was 2 feet to the rim, not much you may say but it also had limited space between the wall, the sink surround and the fixed glass panel on the edge of the bath, (take step ladder with you). The bar area was dismal and dark due to the profusion of national flags for the world cup and all curtains being drawn even though there was no sun penetration for most of the day. The Pool was small and very rarely saw any sun thus it was I was told freezing. The sun bed mattresses were stained and the tables and chairs had seen better days with some rust. The Roof Terrace was nothing to write home about, there were many tables and chairs in a similar condition and there was only one small sunshade by two sun beds. It would be impossible to remain there for more than a few minutes in the full force of the sun. Why they have a unused bar, and what are the showers for?My final piece is left for the food, for the first two nights; the evening self service buffet was truly appalling, it was virtually inedible and the breakfast was not much better. They continually ran out of product (this did not matter whether you arrived at 8 or 10am) I lost count of the number of times that I had to ask for various items. The evening meal improved somewhat when they went over to a set menu for the rest of our stay, this we were told was because of Ramadan.They spent more time readying the tables for the next meal than looking at what was needed to be replenished. I leave my last scathing comment for the standard of the glasses and cups. Many of the cups were either cracked or chipped, the glasses were similarly chipped. At no time should they have been using them for service and should have been placed in a bin for disposal. It's one saving grace is its free WIFI which is the best I have used in any hotel around the world. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone and feel sorry for anyone already booked."}

Two Apple Pie and Custard and Ice Cream finished off the meal, again an excellent choice.It was well worth the visit and I am quite sure that I will return."}

Bags were delivered to our room after we had been shown the way there by a member of staff. There are four restaurants, the main where most guests ate, there are also speciality restaurants serving Thai and Egyptian, these require booking 24 hours in advance at guest services, as we did not partake I cannot comment on the quality. The main restaurant has both external and internal seating. The food was of a decent quality and plentiful however it does have a lack of vegetables. Hygiene appeared to be paramount, all chefs wear gloves at all the time. The gardens within the hotel confines were immaculate tended constantly by the hotels' gardeners'. There are two pool areas, the main pool is an activities and games whilst there is a children's area as well. The other is the relaxation pool where peace and quite are the order of the day (Get there early, as there are only so many beds) it also has it's own bar for drinks and sandwiches. What this area lacks are chairs as well was sun beds for older guests who are unable to use the a sun bed. Do not sit in the bar seats when wet as this can stain your costume, I have had to destroy one such pair as they were stained black.The WiFi is now free, you need to go to reception and obtain a code and password which lasts an hour and you may have them for any number of phones/IPads etc.Cafe Sissi opens at 4pm until late and serves excellent coffee and cake, it affords an excellent view of the nightly entertainment area, this cafe can be reached through the Eagle Lounge which serves drinks in the late afternoon and evening, it is also a quite area to relax.The room was large and airy as was the bathroom with its large shower (no bath). The patio area was large containing a table and two cushioned chairs, there is a large area unused and could perhaps be filled a a sun bed or two negating the necessity of walking to the pool. To find one.The beach and beach bar was a few minutes amble away, there are plenty of sun beds and what was more grit that sand. The are piers to walk out to deep water as the shallow area off shore is unsuitable of swimming. All in all it was an excellent 11 day break and would return if ever in the area.\n\n\nRoom Tip: We stayed in room 18101. It was ideally located for the relaxation pool, restaurant and reception.

What would it be like on our own. We arrived mid afternoon and were greeted in reception by wine and sandwiches as we queued to book in. We were given the exact room that we had requested. having unpacked we lazed around until it was time to go for Dinner via the bar for a pre dinner drink. The following day (Saturday) we spent the morning at the pool relaxing returning to our room before lunch to find a bottle of Cava and two glasses in our room, reception confirmed it as a gift for returning to the hotel (Nice touch). We found yet another bottle on the Monday, this one being for my birthday! The weather to this point had been sunny then cloudy, the location made the clouds go in different directions so you never knew when the sun would breakthrough. Out side our terrace was a lovely flowering shrub which gave some privacy, imagine our dismay when returning to find that the gardener (sic) had used a strimmer to make it all symmetrical, gone had gone our privacy. The pool was reportedly heated, the first time in lasted but a short time, it was colder than the outside temperature (21 degrees C) the pool was reputedly 27 degrees! It must have been heated by a tea light or candle at best, I could not find a thermometer to test the correct figure.The food at all meals was second to none. There was plenty of variety and all was well cooked.There were occasions when glasses and cups had run out and it should be controlled more efficiently to avoid further repeats.The WIFI in the second week was intermittent at best. I found the reception staff very unhelpful giving various excuses and shrugging their shoulders, I requested a refund and was given one without qualms.All in all it was a lovely two weeks although I missed my Granddaughters.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Choose a room in the \"6\" block between 1 and 8 (all on ground floor)\nSee more room tips"}

On arrival at the room we found that we had been allocated a strange configuration in that it was set at an angle for no apparent reason seeing that the hotel is a square building. it did however make the room appear larger. The only drawback was the location of the toilet which was set at an angle thus making it impossible to sit square as there was a supplementary toilet holder on the wall. On waking and looking forward to a coffee in the room only to find that it had not been replenished after the last guest had left. As we were leaving shortly, there was insufficient time to obtain supplies from reception."}

We were ferried to the departure point by bus that actually arrived on time. We transferred to the new bus and were greeted by our \"jack of all trades\" Rocky, who turned out to be driver, tour guide, waiter, fish feeder and life guard. We left, heading for the California Lighthouse. This lighthouse was built from coral and completed in 1916. It was named after a steamer of the same named that was wrecked on the 23 September 1891. It is an impressive structure that is now closed to the public and needs a little TLC. From there we are taken through a golf resort to be shown million dollar mansions (WHY). Our next stop is at the quaint little church of Alto Vista Chapel. The current Catholic Church was completed in 1952 on the site of the original building built in 1750 by a Venezuelan missionary. We then went to Baby Natural Bridge via a rocky hill that gave good views when climbed. The Natural Bridge is the remaining one of two that have been formed by the sea beating the rock face and finally driving a hole through leaving an archway that by all accounts is to join the other in collapsing into the sea. Leaving there via the ruins of an old gold smelting pot we arrive at the B55 diner for lunch. The lunch wasn't up to much containing either chicken/ribs or fish with pasta and rice, but as we had not been eating lunch it mattered little, it did however enable people to change for the beach our next stop. It also enabled ne to sort out my camera damaged when I fell over at the Bridge. We stopped what is called Baby Beach, so named due to its shallow watered beach suitable for young children. Coach party members were offered free snorkelling equipment to see the myriad of fish that frequent the reef, they were brought to the area by Rocky feeding them bread. After a very nice cooling swim we changed and then return to our hotel. I would recommend this somewhat pricey trip."}

They sell them as Suites but are in fact split into two types, one being a one bedroom Suite and the other is a one room Studio. I was caught out by the small print when booking with Thompson Holidays. We were met at the Airport by a Thompson member of staff who pointed us in the direction of transfer coach; imagine the surprise to find hotel staff there to complete the formalities of registering and leaving only a trip to the bar on arrival, our baggage being sent ahead to our room. Room 73 Dutch Village: - A large barn of a room overlooks the garden and pool. It contained a small kitchenette (with crockery, cutlery kettle, hob and microwave, bathroom/closet and changing area with safe and enough towels to sink a battleship. The bathroom had a bath/shower sink and toilet with hair drier. The main room consisted of a large King sized bed, couch/put down bed, table and four chairs, one rattan armchair. The terrace contained a sun lounger, table and four chairs. The room was fairly tired looking; the door to the toilet from the main room had peeling veneer resulting from water damage? The bath had ingrained ring dirt and there was mould on the grouting between bath and wall. The insect screen on the patio door/window was torn therefore negating its use. The biggest bugbear regarding the room was that a window next to the entrance door in the kitchenette lacked any curtaining therefore the lights outside that were constantly on all night streamed into the room ensuring that darkness never came. We had a blocked toilet early in the visit that was quickly sorted. We were told on arrival that water is a scarce commodity in Aruba due to the need to use desalination plants, however, this proved difficult as we wasted gallons trying to get the hot water to flow. The pool located within 25 feet of our terrace was a welcome bonus although this too needs emptying and thoroughly scrubbing to remove ingrained dirt, there are tiles missing near to the small bridge across the pool. The pool is for the exclusive use of Dutch Village residents although this is not enforced by the hotel as no one ever checked the entitlement. On one occasion a large party turned up and virtually commandeered the whole area (reported to be a local Senator) allowing their children to run, jump and dive around and into the pool (All specifically prohibited by the hotel). Getting around was easy as there are constant small vehicles shuttling between all areas of the hotel and the sister Divi All Inclusive Resort and Alhambra Casino. There are several bars in the resort and at the Divi, all available at no extra cost. The Bunker Bar over the beach is open from 11am until 6pm and on occasion is available for coffee when closed. The main Bar is next to the main restaurant and is open from 11am until 1am. The Pizza bar also has the same hours. The Wi Fi is an extra at both hotels and is extortionate in its cost. A cheaper alternative is to take the shuttle down to the Alhambra Shopping area where you can purchase a snack and a drink using their free Wi Fi. We found that it is not ultra-quick but quite adequate for our needs. Restaurants: - The main restaurant (Cunucu Terrace) at the resort serves breakfast, lunch and evening meals. The staff are excellent and most helpful; a table overlooking the sea at breakfast is a pleasure. We did not partake of lunch so cannot comment on its quality. Breakfast was excellent, it had all the necessary ingredients for a continental breakfast with abundant fruit, pastries etc. There were two toasters available. Porridge and cereals were available with a choice of skimmed or full fat milk and juice. Eggs of any description to order with American bacon (not to my liking) sausages, potatoes, tomatoes and corned beef hash. The evening meal was somewhat different, it was of poor quality and the carvery meat tended to be dry. However, there were other options for an evening meal that could be booked at no extra cost; these needed a reservation bookable up to two days in advance. The place to go to book is the desk directly opposite the reception desk and opens at 8am, book early to avoid the queues and get a time of dining to your liking. Palm Grill: - This is located within the main restaurant and allows you to cook your own meal at the table which you will share with either two friends or two strangers. We did not eat here so cannot comment on its quality. Paparazzi: - Italian influence food. Excellent ambiance and food. Good Service. Can book to sit outside (still enclosed) and an air-conditioned area. Highly Recommended. Pizza per Tutti: - Serves pizza, sandwiches and salads late into the night. Again, we did not eat here so cannot comment. Ginger: - Asian influenced restaurant. All seating in air-conditioned room. Variety not large but what was ordered was first class; I can thoroughly recommend both the Tokyo Beef Noodles and the Seafood Udon Noodle Soup. My wife's recommendation is the Spicy Green Curry Chicken and the Mango Chicken. All the above restaurants are located in the Tamarijn All Inclusive. You may however eat at the sister resort at the Divi (also bookable at the Tamarijn concierge). They have a restaurant the Pelican Terrace the same as the Tamarijn but appears to be better presented and in nicer surroundings and has themed nights. Red Parrot: - Serves a limited menu, but excellently cooked. The Tenderloin Steak is a real pleasure that just melts in the mouth. The Butchers' Melange is equally as good and my wife says that the Coconut Shrimp dish was exquisite, both the Rum/Raisin Ice Cream and the Caramel Fondant are also worth ordering. One problem with this restaurant that it is susceptible to flooding during storms. We encountered it on our last night when dinners evacuated the open air dining room due to driving rain and a leaking roof that had water cascading from light fittings onto the diners below. (Tip to Maintenance, repair the roof!) They also have the Coco Grill and Bar (Pizza) which is non-bookable. We visited the Capital, Oranjestad using the local bus (US$2.30 each way) which was a disappointment as there was little old world architecture to see. My advice unless you wish to shop for high end goods, give it a miss as it can be inundated with cruise passengers. All in all, we had a wonderful two weeks of relaxation watching Pelicans diving for fish in the shallow waters. Notwithstanding what I have said about the accommodation, I would return to this resort."}

We were seated looking out to sea, everywhere in the restaurant has a good panoramic view. My wife ordered a Ploughman's Lunch and was able to alter the cheese on offer by omitting the Brie and increasing a portion of another variety which I felt was a nice touch.

We arrived late Friday evening and were confronted with quite a queue as most of our flight appeared to be accommodated at the same hotel. Check In was split two ways, in one queue were families with young children and one for the remainder. The queue diminished quickly due to the efficiency of the reception staff. After a little confusion over whether we had two or three rooms, we were handed our keys and given directions and hotel details. (Tip, If using more than one room, ensure that you fill in the forms with details of the people occupying each room), We were then pointed in the direction of the restaurant for the first of many excellent meals.Staff: All staff were of a very high standard. Whenever there was any debris in the pool, the pool staff were quickly onto it and cleaned it without delay. The restaurant staff were quick to clear tables and to bring equipment that was in short supply. The Entertainment staff were first class, always up and about informing guests of activities. Their morning and afternoon dance around the pool will live deep in the memory. Their one plus however, was that the took a no answer with good grace and did not pester anyone to participate in any of the activities.Meals: Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner were available in the main restaurant. Breakfast was from 7.00am to 10.00am. Lunch 12.30pm to 3.00pm and Dinner 7.30pm to 10.00pm. Every meal time was a pleasure. I could not find fault with any of the food and I am a difficult person to please when it comes to food. There is always something for everyone, be it Soups, Salads or the many varieties hot food. There are ample supplies of soft and alcoholic drinks available at all meals. Its one minor failing for my party was the lack of coffee available at lunch and dinner which necessitated visiting the bar downstairs for a cup.Rooms: All the rooms used by my party were first class with plenty of storage for clothes etc. The bathroom is large and contained a bath, sink, toilet and a shower big enough for a couple at one time! The room contains a TV which have both BBC News and CNN for people who need to know what is going on in the world.Pool Area: There are many pools at the resort at varying depths (all are clearly marked by each set of steps) some that you can literally walk into. All are cleaned regularly and there are staff on hand if urgent mishaps need to be cleared quickly as we experienced first hand. There is a Pizza bar open from late morning until six serving drinks and snacks. Don't order a pizza for yourself as you may wish you had someone to help you after its arrival! The are central bars at various locations although only one was open during our stay due to under occupancy.Evening Entertainment: The is entertainment every evening, either the piano bar (One of the entertainment staff) playing delightfully every evening or in the main entertainment room which consisted of house animation team members dancing and miming to different show tunes to a very good magician. Again, its on a take or leave it, no pressure by anyone.Daily Entertainment: There are many activities available during the day. These consist of (and its not a full list) Pistol and Rifle shooting (.22), Archery, Volleyball, Boules, Water Polo and Table Tennis, these are for both adults and teens. Tiny Tots are looked after in the Kiddies Club.All in all this was a hotel to spend a pleasurable fortnight and if I ever return to the island of La Palma I would not stay anywhere else.A word of warning, if you want external night life this is not for you as the hotel's location is isolated.Finally, anyone wanting something different from the normal hurley burley of the Canaries, this may be the place for you.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Rooms 6001 - 6008 offer ease of access to both the main hotel buildings and pools. rooms 6002/6002s...\nSee more room tips"}

Our first port of call having traipsed round Istanbul collecting various passengers was the DolmabahaÃ§e Palace. It is a vast place with many interesting artefacts and decorations, the rooms are overlarge and very ornate (If visiting independently, you will require a guide) It took well over an hour to traverse all the rooms that are open to the public and there are several renovations in progress. It is something not to be missed on a visit to Istanbul.The Spice Market was our next port of call and we were given about 50 minutes to look round and purchase anything we liked. Having met up with most of our fellow travellers (two went walkabouts) we walked to the restaurant under the Galata Bridge. We were given a \"mese\" starter and offered fish or chicken for main course finishing with fresh fruit. It was what one would normally expect on such a trip. Whilst lunching we were able to observe the comings and goings on the Golden Horn not forgetting the many fishing lines from the bridge of locals catching their supper.Having located our miscreants we made our way to the bus and headed to the Piere Loti Hill, which afforded spectacular views of the inlet. Returning to road level we headed for our final port of call, the boat ride up the Bosphorus. We caught on of the many ferries that ply their trade along this route. It was a pleasurable way to spend an hour and a half cruising between Europe and Asia. (Note: wrap up warm as the wind can knock the temperature down many a notch).The whole day was an excellent way to spend our last full day in Istanbul. Our Guide for the day was most knowledgeable and had a very good command of the English language. He never stopped imparting information as to our surroundings.Although pricey, it was well worth the money as we had a wonderful day out. Thank you Fuad."}

The first being that on the 18th we got back to our room at around 13:30 to find that it had not been made up. We saw a lady in the hall, who said that it was not here section but she would get someone to attend to it. We returned 45min later and the room was done, so big ups to the lady for getting that sorted. Still for the number of rooms in this hotel it shouldn't take that long to get the rooms made up. Second at breakfast on Saturday morning the staff were all attentive and we didn't have to wait for any service or for plates to be cleared. On Sunday morning was a different story. The staff on duty were more worried about playing on their cell phones that attending to the guests. We had to wait an age to be offered any tea or coffee. The staff jumped into action when a manager was around, but went right back to messing around when they had gone. The staff knew where the blindspots were, so that they could not be seen. But there poor service and unprofessional attitude was there for all the guests to see."}

The Legion is based in the small town of Turriff, 20 odd miles west of Aberdeen. We found it to be very clean and tidy. The bedroom although smaller than some we have stayed in was more than adequate for our needs. It contained a double bed, wardrobe, bedside cabinet and light with coffee making facilities near the window. The en-suite had toilet, sink and shower, although smallish, it was again enough for our needs.We only ate breakfast which was excellent. It was made up of 3 different types of Fruit Juice, 3 different cereals, Coffee or tea and a choice of cooked meals. They cease service at 9am.We found the staff very pleasant and helpful. The lift to the upper floor is manually operated, that is to say that you have to be in touch of the controls at all times for it operate.We enjoyed our stay very much and will be returning next Easter."}

Well what a disaster. Before we left i asked how often the buses ran and was told every 30min. Well we waited 30min at Constitution Hall, and then walked to the Hard Rock which took another 30min. Only then were we passed by when we got to the Hard Rock. At the Rocky Steps we waited over an hour. Only for other bus operators to have 2-3 busses go past. Due to this we missed our Ducks time and couldn't change it for another slot. My advice, spend $14 a buy a 1day metro travel card, and not waste your time with the Big Bus Tour. If you have time to waste, then by all means it is a good tour. If you looking for speed this is not the thing to do."}

The hotel is situated on HÃ¼daverdigar Caddesi which is close to The Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, The Underground Cisterns, St Sophia Museum and The Grand \u0026 Spice Bazaars. We were greeted by excellent staff and after a short booking in process we were shown to our room. Having unpacked we were greeted in the Lobby by a member of staff who gave us a comprehensive map and located on it various sights etc. we found this most helpful.Hotel: The room was on the smallish side and located to the rear of the hotel away from the hustle and bustle of the trams which are constantly up and down the street, blowing their horns or bells. The walls and ceilings are not insulated enough as we could hear the plumbing when someone upstairs used the toilet . The curtains do not close, therefore light sleepers are liable to be woken at dawn. There was little space to store clothing with only a small wardrobe and a few small drawers. Having said this, it was quite adequate for our needs.The breakfast consisted of cold foods in the main with a few hot items such as hard boiled eggs. Juice, coffee and tea, bread, toaster, croissants, buns and pastries. I enjoyed the honey which was presented on a honeycomb ( I have never seen such a thing in any hotel).There are two lifts in the hotel, a four man and two man. The two man will only take one person if a couple are somewhat overweight and the same can happen in the four man.My wife celebrated her birthday whilst we were there and we arrived back to find the room had been decorated with balloons and bottle of wine. It was a very nice thoughtful touch that was much appreciated.Overall, this hotel, not withstanding the above was just right for us and I would have little problem in recommending to friends and family and we ever return to Istanbul we will definitely return to The Orient Express\n\n\nRoom Tip: Request a room to the rear of the hotel\nSee more room tips"}

The Accommodation is split either side of the complex running down from the Reception/Dining area to the Pool and Sea. We upgraded to the rooms at the bottom with a partial sea view. The rooms are in blocks either two storey (at the top) and three storey as you go towards the sea. The pool is adequate for the number of rooms and there were never many people in the pool at any one time. It water is clean although some of the steps into the pool require attention. The is a bar and a small cafe by the pool, the food although limited in variety is of a good quality and there was always a \"chef's special\" each day. The meals in the main Restaurant varied. Breakfast was a buffet type with freshly cooked eggs to order with bacon and sausage, freshly cooked pancakes, cheese and cold meats together with yoghurt and fresh fruit. Lunch again was a buffet and on the rare occasion we climbed the incline too was of reasonable quality. The Dinner meal however, left a lot to be desired. The week consisted of four nights in the main restaurant and three outside on the terrace. The four meals lacked choice with only a main meat course or fish course or vegetarian option after a soup course, dessert normally being fruit and small cakes etc.Of the three outdoor affairs, two were pretty poor with chewy meat (you need to be early to enjoy any prime cuts). The BBQ night was definately the stand out with thin strips on tender meat together with roasted corn cobs and veg.The accommodation was clean and tidy and if something wasn't working properly it was quickly attended to. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was well appointed. One thing I noticed during my visit was that empty rooms were ventilated each day by opening the main door and terrace door.With the Sun loungers guests were actively encouraged to moved them to a place where guests wanted to be and not having to use where the management wanted. Staff brought out mattresses and took them away every evening before the monkey's arrive.The Staff throughout the hotel were excellent who were happy to help at anytime with whatever the guest needed. I felt sorry for the entertainment staff who were struggling to get some of the older guests involved. Each evening there was entertainment consisting of local dancing, acrobats, fashion show, the inhouse Colobus Squad and a live band.All in all we had an enjoyable holiday relaxing in the sun, my only major gripe is that as this hotel is fully all inclusive, why were we asked to sign for every drink and bar meal we had.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Upgrade to the sea view rooms at a cost of about Â£200 for a fortnight.

My wife's meal came without chips but as my meal had enough for two so there was no problem and they reduced the bill accordingly. Well worth a visit as they have an extensive menu.

The deluxe room we occupied was excellent, spacious and well appointed and have no complaint other than that the lighting system needed explaining as it was a pain to get it to work as I wanted. The breakfast was excellent and could only fault the dry bacon which was virtually inedible. There was both hot and cold food with eggs to order. A good start to the day. The hotel is well out of town but is quite close to the very good and cheap Metro system. No shorts are allowed in the restaurant for dinner, however, you can remain in shorts on level 11 (The pool area) and obtain pricey bar meals and beer.The infinty pool is small but adequate and provides towels and sun beds. There is also a sauna and Gym provisions on the same floor. It is a non smoking hotel with the exception of the bar area on the 11th floor. I found the reception staff, smart and helpful. I have one complaint in that I was advised by the conciege not to use one of the many cheaper companies to travel to Abu Dhabi as they had had many complaints and to use a more expensive firm (Desert Rangers) as they considered them the best. They insisted on payment in cash. The firm turned up 1Â½ hours late with a driver with poor command of Engish. We did not get what we paid for and after complaining on my return the head of department tried to wheedle out of his responsibilties, needless to say I was not reimbused for any of the trip and I know why they insist on a cash payment before travelling. If ever I return to Dubai I will ensure that this hotel however good in most aspects will not be on my itinery."}

My reference was the evening as the whole area was lit up and it afforded good views of the fountain displays beneath.

It was obvious from the coldness of the fries that it had sat in the kitchen having been cooked at the same time or shortly after the starter. It was the most expensive meal in my 4 weeks travelling throughout the United States. The impression I got was they were trying to maximise their income in the shortest time possible.

Hackberry General Store is a must see for travellers on the Mother Road. The store itself is a hotchpotch of clothing and Route 66 memorabilia and gifts. Its finest point if you are male is to visit the restroom at the back of the store near the jackets. Every available space is covered in glossy pin ups it is sight I have never seen throughout my worldly travels. My wife complained that there is nothing comparable in their restroom! Come on owners sort it out for the girls! Full marks for decor."}

The floor indicator in the lift (elevator) counts them off in 10's so you are able to see how fast you are travelling although you cannot feel it. Once at the top you may wander round at leisure admiring the stunning pamoramic views of the City. There are three glass boxes attached to the building where you can walk on a glass floor and see down to ground level (that is if you have the stomach for it). In the end box is the Towers' Photographer. If you have your photograph taken expect to be charged an arm and a leg when you return to the lower levels.

My wife and I were made most welcome. The room was on suite although the family room had a separate bathroom. They only take B \u0026 B but the standard of breakfast was excellent. The view overlooking Banff Bay was a pleasure, most other hotels I have frequented tended to lack views of any description. Well worth a few days if visiting the area."}

We went on an all inclusive basis which covered everything that my wife and I required. The facilities in the main were first class, although not using the Spa, Sauna etc, I did a quick inspection of this aspect of the hotel and found it to be up to the task. The pools are was excellent and well maintained with all pools being cleaned every evening. The one drawback of the pool environment was the incessant \"boom boom\" of the music which catered for the younger clientele, perhaps and hours peace morning and afternoon might suit the older guests. The food tended to be a little \"samey\" although it's quality was up to the mark. My only criticism is that coffee is not available after every meal, coffee after lunch and dinner meant either going to the pool bar using a polystyrene cup or using the hotel bar. The one real problem the hotel has are the lifts, in block A there are two lifts both designed to carry a maximum of only four people of normal weight. One of the two could only manage three. This problem needs to be addressed sooner rather than later as there are more than 120 rooms served by these lifts. The hotel staff throughout the hotel were helpful and efficient. It is well situated being a 5 mile Dolmus journey into the centre of Kusadasi and also its proximity to Ephesus amd Pamukkale, both visited and enjoyed immensely.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Rooms opposite the pool and bar area are excellent if you require a quieter area\nSee more room tips"}

It has a quite extensive menu including a full Chinese Menu. The meals are well cooked from scratch and offer good value for money. I only found Bailey's shortly before leaving and wished that I had found it on day 1 of my holiday. It also has good value beer at 2 Euro a time, soft drinks, wines etc. Other than the food and drink it offers two televisions that have full coverage of all premier league, champions league and FA Cup. This Cafe Bistro is not to be missed.From The Lancastrian."}
