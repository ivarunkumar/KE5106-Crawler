Plus you can bring home a 6R sized photo for free! Such a good deal! We were not able to try all the rides due to limited time we reached the park before lunch and went out exactly at the park's closing time. It was a tiring but fun day! I'll definitely come back here to try the other rides that I was not able to try. The best ride I tried was Transformers and Battlestar Galactica-Human. Worth all the wait! And oh if you don't want to wait too long for Battlestar galactica ride one tip i can give is try riding it before the park close no lines and whatsoever! Haha!I'm just sad that I was not able to take photos with the characters especially Minions because they only come out for a couple of mins and they won't allow you to line up if its past the given time. Boo!!! Longer time pls. And oh fireworks! Make it everyday instead of just weekends and holidays pls! Went shopping at the USS store for souvenirs I got lucky somehow cause there are shirts that were on sale on the day we came so I was able to get shirts for the whole family! Yay! But its quite expensive there guys. So better have extra cash!"}

No problems encountered while checking in. There were lots of tourist when we came but they were able to assist us immediately we requested for a room with a view we booked Superior room but we were given a complimentary upgrade to a Premier room!Room number was 1315. It has a great view of the city. They always clean the room after going out even when they don't have the sign clean the room outside the door, they always provide complimentary water (plus points since water in SG is quite expensive). You should bring adapter since they don't have one in the room but we were not able to try to request. You can request for laundry bag for free. Our room was spacious for the two of us. It has a couch and you can sit beside the window overlooking the city or you can place your luggage there too. Bathroom was clean and amenities were complete and it has a hot and cold shower. Hotel also has wifi in every room.Location of the hotel is perfect! Near the city and its just below the Lavender MRT station, there is a bus stop at the side of the hotel and at the ground level of the hotel there are a lot of food court.We didn't book the room with breakfast so we have not tried any of the hotel food.The hotel has a pool located at the 4th floor but we didn't try since we were too busy strolling the city. If you want nightlife btw, Haji Lane is 10 mins walk to the hotel! Shopping wise 20 mins walk to Bugis street. Very good location!The hotel also sells discounted tickets to some tourist attractions in SG just like Universal studios. You just have to call the reception to inquire.I will recommend this place to my friends and will consider this hotel again when we go back to SG."}

Our room was spacious and clean, clean comfort room, no airconditioner, 3 fans, it was soooo hot! Seriously no cool breeze of air. We were sweating! Good thing my friend brought her tent with her so we pitched the tent outside our room bring the 1 fan outside and as well as the foams so we did glamping style. Ladies slept at the tent and men at the room. Seriously it was so hot even if its night time.At the beach area, lowtide is from 9am-2pm it was a dry beach. Kindda disappointing but we did island hopping so that we can still swim around those time. Paid 250.00 each for island hopping. False advertisement were around the resort there is banana boat, jetski and flying fish but its no where to be found. But you can rent a ball to play beach volleyball for 100/hr.There is a fire dance at night we were napping around 6-7pm when someone tried to wake us up just to say that there is a fire dance and its about to start.. That's so rude!No electricity at the resort around 6am-11am and 2pm-6pm. There are times that there is no water at the cr but it will come back eventually. There is a fee for everything in the resort and its expensive! We paid for our room still you have to pay entrance fee, shuttle fee, we borrowed a cooking materials and there's fee as well.Nope, not coming back here again."}

But what i like the most is the wax figure of Michael Jackson's you wouldn't think it was a wax figure!!! I also like the cartoons, hello kitty, astroboy, doraemon, etc... O find it really cute! The place could get crowded and you have to fall inline to take pictures with some wax figures.

The place is easily accessible so a lot of families go there for picnic.What makes Kawasan falls awesome for me is the canyoneering adventure - trek, hike, jump and swim to get there. We booked a tour with Kawasan Canyoneering for P1500 inclusive of a tour guide, motorcycle ride to get to the starting point of the trek (they didn't tell you that you'll ride a motorcycle on rough roads and cliff-side. Scary but the scenery is worth it), life vest, head gear and lunch. Canyoneering to get to Kawasan Falls is fun and there are some cliff jumps you can try which is a pretty unique experience. It's a wonderful way to leave your comfort zone and enjoy nature's beauty! :)"}

We were not able to go to ocean park but they also sell discounted tickets to OP and Disney (we already bought our discounted tickets for disney in Manila).

We got confused at first that we ended up completing abour 2-3km of Trail 14 until we got to another marker that we realized we were following the wrong path. We went back to the spot and started looking for the 14-1 trail. We spent the first half of the day doing Trail 14.When we headed to Trail 14-1 which was the intial plan, it was past noon already so the sun was up and it was hot (we did the trail on a summer day). It was a cool experience because the trail will bring you to the peak where you get a great 360 degree view of Jeju! It will take you inside a forest. You might even meet some horses along the way. By the time you'll get to the midpoint, which is the Osulloc Museum, you will realize how much you miss civilization and strangers. The trail will connect you to nature. You'll even find yourself in a dense forest! There are a lot of blue/orange ribbons so you won't be lost. This trail taught me to simply trust and find the blue/orange ribbons and enjoy/embrace nature wherever the trail (or life in general) may take you. Haha. This is definitely off the beaten path but it makes your Jeju tour even more special and truly your own. I would want to do more of the Olleh Trails in the future :)"}

Weird. I also like the free shuttle service around BGC though there is a schedule... at least its free you don't need to bring your car with you to pay for parking fees at the mall. Some staffs are friendly but some does not even smile back at you... Regarding the breakfast.. It was okay nothing much special.. They should always have bacon ready since it rans out fast... Very fast!Pool... Cold. I was not able to swim so much because its freezing cold! hope they could have a heater on there pool in the future.I love chilling out at the 3rd floor there are sofa beds there!Love the hotel's location to since its at the center of BGC 5-10 minutes walk from Highstreet!!!Checking out, there was a long line when we checked out.

The room is big enough for the two of us. There is nothing special about the room i think its just a plain hotel room What i honestly like about this hotel is the service they provide to their guest from the time the shuttle service picks you up from Dmall, you check in, the welcome drinks ad to the time you check out. Such hospitable people! Kudos to everyone. Another thing that I like is the Infinity pool! Its just so gorgeous and picture perfect especially at night!

The room was huge. Big bed, Aircon was great. Clean bathroom, They also provide clean towels which you cannot bring outside the beach, they have a small TV inside the room (i really think that they should upgrade that), no wifi in the room btw and there is a charge for the wifi at the lobby (good thing i have data plan)Don't expect anything special on their breakfast buffet just plain ham, eggs, hotdog, pancakes, nothing special really.What i really like about this resort is that its beachfront! Its rare to see a cheap accommodation near the beach! Its in station 3 right beside Sands Hotel. You can still relax at night because its far away from the busy party area in Station 2! You need to walk not less than 20 mins for you to reach DMALL but its a good exercise.Another thing that i like at this place is the staffs. Everyone was so friendly and hospitable especially the group of ladies at the reception. Thank you for the warm service! I recommend this place to everyone."}

This is way better than zoos because they are not caged and they have a huge place to roam around. Be careful not to touch them especially from the back or when they're unaware. My fiance did it out of curiosity (even if there are reminders on not to do it). The monkey turned back to see who touched him with an angry and ready-to-attack face. We quickly ran away but the monkey was still able to grab his backpack. Good thing there were a lot of staff and he was able to stop the monkey before it attacks us. So, the moral is follow the rules. LOL!In our most recent visit, we were already outside the forest buying local souvenirs. We were a few feet away from our car when one of the monkey grabbed the black plastic bag (where our newly- bought souvenirs are) and took one of the items there. He climbed a tree and we couldn't nor the staff get it back from him. Maybe he thought there's food inside. So if you're carrying any plastic bag even if you're outside the forest, still guard your belongings.Despite the angry monkey and the lost souvenir, we still got home safe and unscathed. I'd still recommend this place because it's unique and more ethical than most zoos. The place is huge so there are mini temple and a river inside."}

Stayed here last Feb 2013 as a Surprise Valentines Day celebration with my bf together with my lil sister since she loves to swim! The hotel's lobby which is located on the 7th floor was huge and modern! Check in took time (got there around 2 PM i was able to check in almost 3PM) because it was a weekend and there were a lot of people! Stayed in a Deluxe room room (twin bed) since King size are not available when we checked in. Room was quite small but i'm okay with it because I must say the hotel's bed and pillows are the best! Its super soft and comfy! The bathroom is clean and complete with the hotel complimentary necessity. I designed the room with all the pictures, balloons, cakes, etc.. and it was an easy task since the room was not that huge to decorate. Good thing! The hotel swimming pool located at the Deck Bar (7th flr) was a no no for me because it was too cold! I was able to swim for less than 30 mins because I was freezing! Literally! So my bf and I decided to chill in the deck bar ordered some cocktail and a snack while watching my lil sister enjoy the pool! hopefully the hotel might want to consider installing a heater in the future haha! Best part of our stay was the BUFFET BREAKFAST at Cafe 8 the breakfast was soooo good! The variety of foods they offer are the best its like having brunch! The hotel also offers free shuttle service if you would like to go to nearby areas such as malls, etc.. as for me I rode the free shuttle going to work the day I checked in since I left something at work! Plus points that I dont need to drive and park my car! Good thing I work near the hotel! Overall, our stay was good. I would recommend this hotel to my friend who would like to have a staycation!"}

We immediately booked it without a doubt plus the room was discounted! Yays! The bellboy offered us to bring our things in our room and we rode a golf caddy on our way to our room! The room was spacious, it has a H/C shower and bath tub which my sister loves the most! The room has a view of the taal lake and at the left side view of Sky Ranch Tagaytay!

Next day, I called Marco Polo again to ask some help for a surprise for my bf then I explained what I wanted and the guy I spoke with told me that they will work it out. Few hours after that phone call a lady called me to follow up BTW her name was Sheena Galvez, we exchanged emails after that. Not to mention that this was a day before our stay.When we got in the hotel.. the only problem that we had is that only one elevator is operating from the 5th flr parking that goes directly to the lobby so we really waited a long time before we were able to go up (not so much of a biggy for us but hopefully next time operate all elevators since its a waste of time to wait for 10 mins for an elevator ride)Check In went smoothly didn't take so much of our time.. we went directly to the 44th floor (The Continental Club) where Sheena is and she was all smile when she saw us and offered us a drink. Waited for a short time before we go to our room since Sheena told me that the room was not ready for the \"surprise\" then when she got back she told us that we can go to our room which is 3114 when I got in I was surprise since the room is spacious! The bed was big and comfy, pillows were so soft, Huge bathroom which I totally love, extra pillow inside the cabinet, extra glasswares, the phone which is a charger a speaker and an alarm clock in one, Digital do not disturb and clean up room sign and the NESPRESSO MACHINE! But the most important part was the surprise.. there's a Complimentary wine, our picture in a frame, and the letter for my bf which I emailed to Ms Sheena day before waiting for us. I was so happy because my bf didn't expect that there will be a surprise for him waiting inside our room. 15 mins after a bellboy came and it was a complimentary cake too (SWEET!) --- not to mention that they did not charge me for anything for the surprise that I requested! THANK YOU SO MUCH MARCO POLO FOR MAKING THIS POSSIBLE especially to SHEENA GALVEZ! Kudos to you! You deserve more than the small gift we gave you.After taking a short nap we went out for dinner the hotel is located nearby the malls in Ortigas area, one cab away if you don't want to bring a car (but hopefully in the future Marco Polo offers a free shuttle service that will cater to there customers not only in the airport but also in the nearby malls around the area). When we got back our room was tidy up again and there was another surprise waiting for us... a TEDDY BEAR! Super sweet! I have no idea that there would be another surprise. I was so overwhelmed. I must say I am a very happy customer. 2nd day, Buffet Breakfast was soooo good, you can choose from the wide variety of food Cucina offers.We were able to visit the infinity pool but we were not able to swim because the water was too cold! But he guy there told us that they are in the process of installing a heater which I think will be great! (the next time I visit hopefully its already installed) We were able to visit the other part of the hotel which is the function room, grand ballroom, VU's Bar everything is just great! Marco Polo definitely exceeded our expectation I'll make sure to go back here! :)\n\n\nRoom Tip: Choose Higher floors for better view of the city!\nSee more room tips"}

It was hard enough to get the manager's attention in settling the bill as there were a lot of people queuing for their rooms and other concerns. My fiance and I came from Manila and we were disappointed by how much smaller and less attractive the place was in reality than what we expected. The room was honestly not anything close to P2800 in value as we were only there for a few hours that day. The cabinet in the room was old and dirty, as well as the other furniture.

We just walked from out hotel to the location of Zubuchon in Escario St. it was a 10 mins walk.When we got there the staffs immediately greeted us good afternoon and with all smiles! We ordered the ever so famous Zubuchon lechon, Zubuchon Sisig, kangkong and another food which i forgot what it is. All i can say is same as Anthony Bourdain's review \"BEST PIG EVER!\" Haha! The lechon skin was Crunchy, the lechon was so juicy and yummy! Same as the lechon sisig it was also one of the best sisig ive ever tasted.It was raining so hard when we were eating in Zubuchon adn we decided to stay and rest for a while until the rain subside.And during the time we dined in a guy with a glasses approached us and asked us how was the food? And since it was raining so hard outside the guy offered us a dessert on the house! We were shy and shocked at first but still this guy insisted and asked if we want to have Cassava cake or Biko. We choose Cassava cake and we thanked this man who offered this to us. When the waitress placed the dessert in our table we asked her who that guy is since he already went out the restaurant and the waiter told us that he is the owner of Zubuchon!!! Not only that branch where we ate because we thought it was a franchise but he is the owner of all the Zubuchon in Cebu!Its a rare opportunity to meet the owner of a business and if we only knew we should have taken a picture together with him. The waiter told us that its his birthday that day and he is really kind. We saw him again riding his car we like to call him to thank him again and greet him happy birthday but he seems in a hurry and we got shy already so we just decided to ake a picture of the cassava cake! Hahaha! But the Cassava cake was so yummy it was not that sweet but it taste really good!But hey on behalf of my friends and I again, MR. JOEL BINAMIRA we would like to thank you for being so kind, being so humble that you didn't even introduce yourself being the owner of Zubuchon, for being so generous and for coming up with a business such as zubuchon. A one in a million experience that we will never forget aside from the yummy food you're restaurant offers. Lucky us!More power and God Bless to Zubuchon and to you Mr. Binamira!Were hoping to have a Zubuchon branches in Manila soon! Yes? Hihi."}

It was aimed as a thank you makan to our high valued clients in celebration of ramadan \u0026 for informal bonding between us and our top customers. It wasn't a buffet kind of thing. More like an all you can eat ala carte dim sum affair. We could order additional, if we wanted to, on top of the initial serving we requested for. Maybe the idea is to discourage wastage which happens too much in this muslim holy month. What happened was that we ordered quite a bit initially that all of us were too stuffed to order anything else after that. This is a gd thing actually because the servings were plenty. From the dishes that we ordered, some were pretty good. The salted egg mushrooms were outstanding for me. I just can't get enough of it. The fried yam was also delicious cooked identical as the penang style char kuay teow. Apart fr that the steamed chee cheong fun dish with prawns inside tasted fresh and prevents staleness from a table filled with dim sums. Other than that, the dishes were pretty decent. If you're into halal dim sum, you could give the dim sum joint in pnb darby park a try. Other than that the ones in quality hotel and sogo is worth a mention. There are currently a slew of chinese muslim restaurants all over town offering dim sum meals at all hours of the day. All in all, i wouldn't mind coming here again. But being a food adventurer, i'd also be inclined the other many food restaurants all around the klang valley."}

Bed and pillows are comfortable.. Each room has its own LCD cable tv but the 2nd room which is Room B, the TV was not working.. Bad side is socket was very limited were group of 5 people and we need to charge a lot of gadgets but they cant provide any extension cable even if its says on their book thing inside the room extension is avail upon request. We called the front desk and the lady told us that they don't have extension wires.Food - complimentary breakfast was so so.. Don't expect too much. Its good to eat something for breakfast than nothing.Customer Service - i really think that the management should invest with the training of the staffs from the hotel guard to the bellboy and almost everyone! When we got to the hotel via taxi we have a lot of baggage but no one helped us bring our bags down except for the taxi driver, the guard was just staring at us and didn't even greet us good morning. When we entered the hotel the receptionist greeted us with a smile so thats a plus. We waited for like 30mins before we were assisted to our room located on the 6th floor.. we stayed in the hotel to take a rest for an hour and found out that one of the TV was not working we immediately called front desk and they told us that someone will go up to fix it. Its been 20mins no one went up called again and no one went up till we decided to have late lunch outside the hotel and buy our ferry tickets bound for Bohol.. maybe we thought that when we come back the tv will be okay since before we left the hotel we advise the receptionist that no one went up to fix the tv. When we got back around 7pm our tv is still busted no one assisted us after several reminders. We called the front desk again and advise abt what happened then after 10mins someone came to our room to fix the tv the tv went on but the man advised us that there was a problem with the cable (tv on the other room was working perfectly fine) they will call skycable i think to report but until we left the hotel no one came back to us to fix that problem.. On our 2nd day we requested to have an extra bed inthe morning before we left for Carmen Cebu so that when we get back in the evening the bed will be ready already when we got back at 8pm our room was a mess even after we left the Clean up room hanging outside our door no one came to fix our room and the extra bed was not there. We need to call the receptionist 2x to req for that extra bed and around 3x to req for an extra pillow and water. So i really think investment to there people is a must.The hotel basically is good if you will just stay here maybe for overnight stays. Not recommended for customer service savvy people."}

It was a windy spring evening in Paris. Still the go-to venue in Paris. A big road and the famous arch-de-triomphe at the end of it. Lovely walk in paris where u will see a gigantic historical monument at the end of it. Kinda like walking in a tunnel and seing a bright light at the end of it as a final destination. Still remember the day france won the world cup in 1998 and seeing all the french supporters celebrating at the arch of victory. This time around, it was election sunday and macron just won. Could see a bunch of his supporters celebrating with flags. And the rest i would say, is history. Wonder what the scenes would be like had le pen won that sunday. Anyway, champs is very important street in Paris. A lot of gd french branded shops to seek out. We spent the evening here after going to louvre, then notre dame and before ending the day to watch the glittering lights at eiffel at 9.30pm when night fallls. At CE we managed to visit a few shops such as the famous LV, Lacoste and the PSG club store. This LV store and the one in Gallerie Lafayette is famous among malaysians because malaysian women basically loves LV. It is a status symbol between the haves and have nots in kuala lumpur and this shop is not available in la vallee. Longchamps \u0026 Lacoste is famous too but does not carry the same status symbol .I once met 2 malaysian girls who are acquaintances of my wife when i came here in 2014. They were holidaying in london and only came to paris for a day via eurostar and guess where their destination was? Yes, you guessed it,.. LV Champs Elysee. What we really wanted at the end of it was to relax and do some people watching sipping coffee and eating french pastries at this legendarily famous street. In the end we settled at a pastry joint called brioch doree. Prices were reasonable and the pastries were excellent compared to what we usually get in malaysia in particular and in asia in general. The difference in paris CE this time compared to our last visit in dec 2014 is that they havr ferrari \u0026 lamborgini cars for rental. I saw quite a few takers enjoying the chance to ride these iconic cars. All in all, i topped all the walking we did on this street to take a couple of photos at the arch. Photos were impressive, as usual."}

It feels really fresh and invigorating to be here. Barcelona, with it's unique buildings and architecture and warm weather, always stands out with other attractions in Europe. And Las Ramblas is one of the key components of this great city. LR itself is a long path which you can walk and enjoy everything. People watching, souvernier huntings, restaurants, food stalls, etc. You can find the la bouqeria mercat somewhere in the middle. There are other attractions on the side such as an erotic museum, etc. For muslim travellers like me, there is even a halal kebab restaurant on the street. There are many restaurants along the walkaway selling barcelona favourites such as paella, tapas, sangria \u0026 wine sellections. La rambla itself is very central and connects to the other attractions at the city centre and the main square. Also to the Roman Quarter.

Read somewhere that the 2 are close to each other in the centre of Barcelona. If you look closely enough after leaving la boqueria \u0026 las Ramblas, or ask the local guys at the stalls, that would be enough to lead you to the GothicQuarter. It is estimated between 5-10 minutes for you to walk to get to there. It is recognisable fr the roman cobblestone steps on the floor and medieval looking buildings/churches in the area. Brings to mind that this catalonian city was once a part of the roman empire. There are many souvenir stalls too everywhere in this area. We found the best souvenir bargains in this area. Do Check out the sports, t-shirts and fridge magnet souvenier deals on sale. A tip for you is, if you need to go madrid after barcelona, get any general spanish souvenirs in madrd instead of barca as it is generally cheaper over thr. At night, one of the squares outside the church at the quarter is quite lively. There are people selling stuff to tourists and plenty of picturesque opportunities nearby the old church. Plenty of restaurants too selling local favourites such as paella, tapas and Sanghria We saw museums here offering flamengo show packages as well but didn't get the opportunity to watch it. Well, maybe next time."}

It looks awesome. It would probably look awesome too in winter or summer because that's what it is. It is a unique looking church. Not an aesthetic looking one like the la sangrada familia but it's appearances lasts in your head longer than the time you visit it. And picture taking in front of it gives a feeling of beauty and an imposing structure feel and a 'been there done that seen that' kind of ancient historical monument. I know there are many historical elements to this building. And it kinda brings you back to the medieval times with that look that it gives. I will leave history to the historians (and to the history channel ) and focus on it on my own. My 5 visits to paris did not bring me here and i was happy to do it this time. There are many tourists in the area. Always busy. And a few dodgy looking individuals. Be cautious of your wallets and valuables when you're here, friends. You'll never know. Eveyone looks so touristy and so friendly. Don't forget also to check out the souvenier shops and restaurants on the other side of that main road. As muslim travellers, we had our fix of halal kebab on the street behind the main shops opposite of this cathedral. If you're into arts, there are plenty of people selling pictures on the road leading to NDC from the metro. All in all this is a must visit place in paris and i would recommend it for all first time travellers to do so."}

And the crowd was filled with beautiful mostly Spanish people and supporters of los blancos. To get to the stadium is very easy as the metro station is named after it. And once u'v reached the station via blue line, the stadium is right next to it. The stadium is huge. We went thru gate b. Noticed that the stadium is a bit dated and In need of some fixing. There were stalls selling souveniers and drinks outside the stadium. Inside the stadium they sold food as well. We had our dinner after the game at a small mall nearby the stadium. We were quite famished and at the stadium waited for the crowd to clear a bit. I love the once in a lifetime matchday experience but i don't think i'll come again.

The room was very clean. The bathroom incl. the shower area relatively spacious compared to the prev 3 accomodations we stayed in at europe. The tv has many channels. The check in super fast as was the check out. The breakfast buffet is quite generous and has variety altho' maybe not the liking of rice loving asians .

Great!!!Even a small roissy village to stretch post breakfast other mealtimes and view the flowers of spring. Restaurants too if ur not into hotel food. Hate to nitpick. But to be a perfect hotel, maybe there are slight improvements needed. For e.g. It wouldn't hurt the frontline staff to smile once in a while.

The first time during the day \u0026 passed by again at night. We stayed nearby the girona metro, hence nearby at only 1km away. Out of the 2 experiences, i would say that it is better at night. Beautiful during the day \u0026 enchanting at night. When the sun sets, they the lights are switched on at certain areas, which brings a certain eerie feel to the otherwise disneylike appearances. Furthermore, it was nearly full moon when we passed by. Don't forget to check out the window glasses which are colourful and pretty. During the day, u get to visit inside. Don't forget to book online for access in order to avoid dissapointment. The aesthetic cathedral view from inside is worth the entrance fees. One can't help but marvel at this gaudi masterpiece. There are many technical details to the building which are best captured or explained by barcelona tourist \u0026 architectural websites and recerences. There are many souvenier shops nearby Sagrada Familia which makes this area a one stop tourist centre. There was a small playground too for kids to have a slide or two. This enables parents to catch a breath or two. Viewing one of Gaudi's greatest work while eating hot churros or cold chocolate churros is highly recommended. Try this little joint by the corner; xurreria sangrada familia to sample this local delight. They have other pastry goodies too but i think their forte is the hot churros with hot chocolate and/ or thick sweet chocolate dips. If Sagrada Familia represents and is a major symbol of barcelona, then it is easy to understand why this catalonian city is described by many in the past and present as the great enchantress."}

It is also near to jesselton port, gaya street and a whole lot of stuff in KK city. Upon check in, we were quite disappointed. This hotel needs to refurbish a bit, especially the worn out carpet in the rooms. The bed was also different compared to the photos in agoda. After a long \u0026 tiring day, managed to sleep peacefully at the bed. I suppose the beds were cozy enough for me. So, no compains from me about the bed comfort levels. Wifi service was rather poor too as we had to reconnect many times. Breakfast, was rather limited but we were still happy that they provided compared to some boutique hotels in gaya street we stayed last year which did not offer this package. Food, whatever was available, was ample. Overall, i'm 50-50 about returning to this hotel again or recommending others to it. A lot needs to be done, especially to the carpets in the room and in the common areas."}

Luckily he's seen the shrek movie before we came here too. He loved the shrek dungeon cinema thingy too. Although the queue was long and the briefing took a while, it was all worth it. The water effects from the donkey sneeze \u0026 other scenes was a major talking point for him all the way back to the hotel. So we knew that the short movie screening was memorable and enjoyable for him. We, the parents could not go for the sci fi rollercoaster rides becoz it was just the 3 of us and my toddler was ineligible for then. One of us had to take care of the child, so it would be less enjoyable to experience it alone. The people we saw who took them seems to have had a really good time. Who knows, maybe we'll be back again when he's grown up to enjoy the rides we couldn't take this time around. Plenty of retail shops and eateries in here too. A great many options from the themed shops all the way to the main one at the entrance. Goods and merchandise cane with plenty of variety and it would be a challenge for anyone coming out of those shops empty handed what with the great many varieties you guys have on offer. Another thing to mention is the appearances by characters which are lively and well scheduled out thruout the day. We had bucketloads of fun with the penguins and other madagascar characters. Special mention to the big guy who hosted the madagascar dance thingy. He is lively \u0026 friendly.

So no transit stops are needed. The room is sufficient enough and cozy. Lucky for us, room was ready at 11am although the official check in time is 2pm.

This is our 1st time here and took the early flight in. Reached SRIA as early as 7am. We went straight to the hotel as we need to store our luggage 1st and obtain a room, if possible. The hotel staff were very warm \u0026 friendly. Mr Ram greeted us \u0026 took our details. It was a very good 1st impression by him apart from the 1st look beauty \u0026 clean cyclo hotel.Mr Thea too was very warm \u0026 friendly, especially towards our son. He is very attentive and responsive towards our every need and situation. As we were early and the stansard check in time is 2pm, we were willing and offered to pay for a day room. Ram advsed us to wait as they tried to get us a room early. Unfortunately, since they were fully booked, we could only secure a room at noon, at best.. we arrived during their water festival celebrations and good hotel rooms are hard to come by at this time of the year. In the end, we got our rooms at 2pm as the departing tenants left late. But we appreciate the effort of the cyclo boutique team to secure us a room quickly. Fear not, we spent half the morning surveying the town and spent the other half at the pool which we enjoyed until our room was ready. This place is Aesthetically pleasing. I admire the owner, designers \u0026 maintenance team. Everything is in good taste here. The rooms, the cafe, the pool, the reception hall, etc..The hotel itself is not in the town area, but there are sufficient shops and facilities in the area. There are souvenir shops nearby, a few mini markets to the left, a couple of massage parlours and the duty free shopping (dfs) outlets at the end of this road.Hotel provides a spa too and a clean pool to swim or relax by the sides. Food and drinks prices aren't too far off compared to the outside rate and there are plenty of sofas and chairs to sit and laze about at the lobby. Although the cafe ladies team aren't as smiley and warm as the reception team, the breakfast portion and quality more than makes up for it. It's a beautiful cafe with well chosen decor and pretty pictures on the wall. The food servings were generous and even my 3 year old son was given a breakfast option. I was there for 3 days and i chose the fried noodles each time. As we are muslims and don't eat pork, I would recommend the beef over the chicken noodles as it is tastier and i think it is the specialty of the indo-chinese people. My wife chose the soupy noodles and i felt i made the better choice . Not to nit pick, but to achieve perfection, there are a few things the hotel may want to look at. We are fully aware that this is a boutique hotel but some designs aren't child friendly. Parents need to be careful as there are many sharp edges to avoid not only for young kids but to adults too. The bathroom, though sufficient, is pretty economical in terms of space. You'll need to exercise caution to prevent bumping into things while moving around the toilet. Another point is that it is not that near to town. You would need transport to reach town area. 2 USD may not sound like much but if you were to travel about daily, it would cost you a small fee otherwise better spent at massages or small souveniers available everywhere. Would i stay here again?, most definitely. Honestly, i'd be lying if i say i wouldn't like to stay in town area where i can drop in and out of massage parlours and shop every free time i had, but the warmth of the hosts and the quality of service is important and is a big point to ponder on. Besides, all the basic stuff are within 5 minutes of the vicinity anyway"}

So, a lot of gd places in kl, penang \u0026 melaka were already booked. So we decided to try swiss garden kuantan because the price appears reasonable, the photos appeared enticing and most importantly, there were still available rooms.We liked the idea of kuantan because it was just 2 hours plus from kl via the LPT highway. There are plenty of patin tempoyak stalls at the temerloh r \u0026 r. The temerloh catering stall is a must try!!We didn't take the new year dinner package and kinda regretted it. The buffet spread looked great with bbq crabs, squids, mantis prawns \u0026 lamb thrown in. It is cheaper to take the package offer during booking time rather than taking the option on the day itself where the price looks higher by 30 per pax.There are plenty of restaurants outside the hotel. They are cheaper options than the ones as the resort but one particular restaurant, yala thai restaurant overcharged us for a decent dinner. They knew we were from kl and probably took advantage of it. Try the sara thai restaurant around 1km from the hotel for better seafood dishes. The hotel itself has plenty of facilities. There are sufficient things to do for a day or two. Child friendly hotel with a very swimmable pool and nice playground too.The beach is breezy and they have parrot bar by the pool and malibu bar on the inside for the thirsty travellers. Rooms seems recently furnished altho some basic facilites looked a little tired and run down. It was ok tho becoz the price of rm270 per nite is still reasonable for the 'offerings' they have in store. Alas, we had to leave for kl after one night as our son was not well. We promise to return here within this year as we felt that we have not enjoyed the hotel and surrounding areas to the fullest. As per the review title suggests, i would recommend this hotel for a few nights stay and it is one of the better hotels in this side of the world."}

This place sells goods which florence is famous for, leather goods \u0026 souvenirs. I suggest u browse around first before making a purchase. There are more than 1 vendor selling the same thing. Best to make a full circle of the outer mercato central to view all available offerings. There are many types of leather here. If you're unsure, just ask the sellers who are predominantly bangladeshi here. My favourites are the leather wallet, handbag \u0026 accessories stalls. Souvenier are also sold here. I managed to get the firenze fridge magnet for around a euro and a half each. Not as cheap as venice or rome but like i said before, it's a one stop centre where almost all products are available and at competitive prices. If you are a muslim traveller, there are a few halal restaurants selling kebab \u0026 rice dishes. There a 1 or 2 facing the main street and 1 or 2 on the back streets. I would recommend the stall on the right as the dishes served were fresher. The halal kebab shop on the left were flexible with food quantity \u0026 mixes but some food were not that good anymore when we visited late on 1 of the nights. I would come here again in a heartbeat. The sellers are lively, buyers from all over the world and the products are quality with a huge range of goods for sale."}

Our airbnb location is situated 20 minutes away from the duomo. We walked there everyday as it is the centre of activity in the heart of florence city. There are many excellent gelato stalls along the way heading to the duomo. 1 such place is don nino gelato on the very sides of the duomo itself.Among other attractions nearby the duomo are sports shops, gucci, prada, souvenir shops, food restaurants, leather shops as well as gelato eateries. Note that if you're keen to buy leather products which is what florence is famous for, go visit mercato central which is 5 minutes away from the duomo.If you're looking for the bistecca ala fiorentina, most of the more affluent restaurants in the area sell it ala carte or packaged in a set with starter, wine \u0026 other delicacies. Visit inside duomo itself if you're an ardent tourist but based on a couple of reviews here. The outside of duomo is more impressive than the inside. There are plenty of local \u0026 italian peddlers selling pictures and other souvenirs. I must say that i regret not buying some of the photos which i could no longer find in my next destination in italy. If you are a muslim traveller, make sure you visit the halal kebab \u0026 bryani restaurants around mercato central. There are at least 2 on the main street and another 1-2 on the side streets. I would recommend the one on the right due to the freshness of the dishes on offer. Other attractions are just around the corner where you will get to see michaelangelo and famous and the famed work of legendary italian painters \u0026 sculptures. You can expect to queue around 30 minutes to an hour to get in. However there are short cut ways to beat the crowd. These 'agents' will approach you outside the long standard queues. The SM Novella church nearby is also an interesting place to visit as there are smaller crowds there. SM Novella itself is home to a small mall which you may find interesting bargains. If you're a shopaholic, make the trip to the factory outlet from SM Novella and i hear it's about 45 minutes trip from there to get the best designer goods. Overall we enjoyed our trip to florence whereby we made the duomo our central area of activity or base to explore the rich culture of firenze. Would happily come here again one day."}

It opened my mind to the culture and uniqueness of amsterdam. One thing i admire is that despite the legalisation of many things considered a taboo in other parts of the world, the dutch people are good, friendly and open minded in general as opposed to the close minded, presumptious and voyeuristic nature of the people in my country and some surrounding neighbours. What a lovely place to visit and view first hand. I would recommend the experience to anyone and everyone."}

Took the hotel on the basis of ratings by past visitors of casa 400 and the price suits our budgetAlready took note of the non central geographical location but was still taken aback when we arrive as we expected the weather was cooler to enable us to make walks into town. Unfortunately that did not take place due to the summer heat, hence we used the metro to reach amsterdam centraal or anywhere else we wanted. Try going the opposite area as the arena (ajax fc, shopping and mall areas are superb.)Distance between the hotel \u0026 the metro is a 10 minutes walk. All well \u0026 good unless you're carrying tons of luggage \u0026 pushing a child stroller coming in \u0026 upon leaving. It takes the exact amount of time walking to the metro as it took to get and reachCentraal by metro. How's that for comparison or funfact?Going back to basics, We really enjoyed some of the basic facilities offered by the hotel. The room size was good, the bed huge, firm \u0026 comfy and the innovative platform area in the room to relax, to do work or to view the city. We were lucky to get the highest floor and an impressive view of certain parts of amsterdam. My son especially loved the platform as he spent hours there every day colouring his book, watching ipad or eating his croissant. Shower \u0026 water pressure was good and it was generally spotless clean everywhere. An important criteria for our hotel selection There is a lot of space inside the bathroom to put our toiletries and the coffee tea selection next to the kettle enough for each nite's stay. The nest outdoor lounge area looks amazing although we didn't have much time to spend there. During both nights, we came back after 12 midnite and hence, this stylish \u0026 chic chillout place had already closed. We noticed the busy crowd of visitors at nest in the mornings and in the afternoons as we were busy rushing out to go spend time visiting the beautiful amsterdam city. Didn't use the east 57 cafe and other places too but heard good reviews of the place. Being a muslim traveller, we only go for halal or vegetarian eatery these days. Had a less memorable check out experience though as a female frontline staff scolded me. Maybe she thought that i was trying to jump queue as there were people waiting to check out of casa 400 at that hour. All i wanted to know when i approached the empty left hand side of their counter is what procedures for check out and whether it was possible for me to place the bags with them as we had a gap of 2-3 hours between the noon check out time and our flight back to kuala lumpur. The blonde lady staff, on duty at 12pm on 15th september took me to task for being there and showing me a queue of visitors waiting to check out. I think her name is ms ruusje and she gave me the impression that i was one of those uninformed guests from china or any 3rd world country attempting to bulldoze my way to try beat the system. To be fair, she did try to apologise later on when i came back to collect my luggage, But by then, the damage was already done. I responded then to her that i understood if she's busy but don't have to be rude to paying customers like me. Another male staff tried to rectify things immediately after the incident. Fair play to him to trying upkeep the hotel's service reputation and standards and covering for her colleagues shortcomings. Apart from that minor incident and the location, i would give top marks for this establishment for the basic accomodation facilities it provides which was beyond our expectations. I would definitely stay here again and i would recommend any of my friends to book here."}

The best rated hotel for our small family budget. Used the hotel for 1 night as we were recuperating from a 17 hour journey from malaysia via doha and had to catch the flight to another destination the following day. Wanted a hotel to rest after a long journey which is near enough to the airport to avoid any inconveniences. The hotel shuttle is welcome and pleasantly regular. After a short nap, the airport was a great alternative to spend a few hours, using the regular free bus as there are enough shops \u0026 restaurants at amsterdam schipol to fulfil a short chill session. The room \u0026 bathroom was sufficient enough and the additional/extra high bed was a welcome addition. My 40 month old kid loved to play his toys up there. The bed/mattress is new and it was easy for me and family to sleep in the evening and at night. On the downside, room \u0026 bathroom were small. I guess you pay for what you get but i cannot imagine a bigger guy (compared to my average asian male body) being able to survive a session in the bathroom without clattering unto something. Special mention shall be given to the charming girl working in front reception counter. She was pleasant during check in, always ready with a smile and answered all my questions readily. One of the first people i met on a short trip to amsterdam and gave a good first impression to amsterdam, holland and to the hotel. All in all, i would recommend this hotel to similar natured travellers but not to those planning to stay in amsterdam for more than a day."}

The units are run down, the tv room has no aircond, some furnitures are broken and the lift broke down once. I think they need to spend to improve this hotel. Probably a change of management might help. I don't think this resort has many repeat visitors. My dad came here 10 years ago and was shocked to see the state of the place now. The plus side is the location, which is pretty near the airport \u0026 padang matsirat. PM has many decent restaurants and it's less than 10 kilometers to reach pantai chenang, the main tourist area. We rented a car and you would need it if you're staying here. There are also some cheap breakfast joints on the left, after the pink bridge. The kelantan stall on the right (atv/horseride) serves good nasi lemak though the roti canai is a bit oily. A takeaway meal for 7-8 people without drinks only costs us less than myr20.

The bakso wasn't too great but we were happy with the mixed rice stall that we bought from. Idr 20k can get you a plate of rice together with 4 side dishes from the selection on display. The yet-to-be-grilled satay stuff costs 20k too. We bought bakso for 15k a packet. There are also stalls selling grilled fish. From my earlier negotiation, the price is 70-100k for a grilled red snapper (kakap) with 2 rice and a veggie dish. To me this was alright for an island resort. It wasn't our pick this time but a friend of mine told me the stall to the left had the tastiest \u0026 freshest grilled fish.

It is quite hidden \u0026 situated in the village area of kg kerandangan in senggigiAlthough it is away from the senggigi main stretch, there are plenty of ways to make the most out of this hidden paradise. Firstly, you need to have a vehicle. A motorbike for individuals or couples and a car for families. Lombok roads are not as busy as bali so moving on your own is a good idea. Get a big car with driver if you travel in a group to enable cost sharing and comfortable to move from one place to another with enough space for luggage. An 8 seater elf with driver \u0026 petrol for 10 hours would only cost around idr 650-850k per day whilst a 6 seater pregio with the same package will be 650-700k max. The requirement for a car reminds me of when i travelled to australia in 2013 \u0026 LA years earlier. It's very much a car country. A bicycle is not sufficient unless you stay in smaller islands like gili Trawangan. The villas are very nice. Apart fr the occasional blackouts \u0026 slight distance, it was perfect for us. We travelled in a family of 7. The kitchen had enough equipments to open a small restaurant. The toilet was clean \u0026 the living room was huge as was the outside patio area. There were hardly any people using the swimming pool, so we swam quite a bit. The best part about the place is the barbecue set, sink and eating area next to it. One outsidedining area was open while the other one was closed. Great options here as well as opportunity for photo sessions here (think IG/Selfies). Of the 3 nights we were there, 1 of them we had a delicious dinner at blue ocean seafood restaurant while the other 2 nights we did our own barbecue outside using the common facilities. We had separate menus for both occasions. This we will take back the form of sweet memories of our time together. The staff are polite \u0026 decent as was the other guests staying nearby. They helped arrange massages, taxis \u0026 when they were not around, the security guy can also arrange the same. For supplies such as drinks, bread, eggs \u0026 prepaid cards, just step out to the hindu shop outside the resort. Other shops heading to the main road sells basically the same stuff too. If you are keen to use the kitchen to prepare your own meals, take advantage of the groceries lorry in the morning. You will find a lady operating a small truck packed with vege, seafood \u0026 chicken in front of the shop next door to DER every morning at 9am. Overall we will stay here again. Based on the above reasons, i'd say, why not?"}

In fact, this is our 3rd or 4th visit. This time, i decided to review the restaurant. We love it here. Everytime we go to Ikano/Curve area, this is one of our top 3 choices.We love it for the simple fact that it is good value for the price and the chilli is damn tasty. Try mixing the 'sambal' with the fried onion/oil accompaniment. We find that the Noodles and ingredients that come with it are well worth the value and guaranteed to fill our bellies. For small eaters, you can even share a portion with another person. It's that much. My personal favourite is the fish head noodle while my wife loves the fishball noodles with tomyam stock. The fish head portion is ample \u0026 quite fresh too. Would definitely come here again, and again.."}

The rooms is alright as it is still a new hotel. Heard that it is in the same group as Tiara hotel. If so, they are experienced enough in this industry in Labuan.I like the toiletries set here. It is simple but looks classier than most of those fr other hotels. The shower pressure is strong too \u0026 that makes me look forward to taking a bath here. There are 2 kinds of shower and the rainfall type is my favourite. Buffet breakfast selection is decent. I find the rendang nasi lemak tasty \u0026 the eggs made pretty well. Juices were alrite too although only 2 too choose from. Dining area was huge and the only thing i dislike is the construction view next door which is a huge part of the view. Room cleaning is prompt \u0026 they are always around the floor somewhere. This makes it easy for me to locate \u0026 inform them verbally that my room is ready for cleaning. In general, the staff team is relatively young. They appear vibrant \u0026 bubbly but requires minor refinement in customer service. Kudos to the hotel team here. I feel that this hotel, due to it's central location in between ujana \u0026 the port/town area has huge potential and is the up and coming hotel to watch in this market. All amenities are in close proximity and there is no need for a vehicle here if your business is around this area. Huge savings in that sense. I have already stayed in this hotel twice and would gladly come back here again for my next trip."}

Lucky us . It is clear that they put a lot of attention to details here. The building design, the furnitures \u0026 fittings they use, the selection of the frontline team, the training to the staff, the service standard, the food quality and even the products/merchandise they use. Small stuff like tissue, toilet rolls \u0026 toiletries are of a certain quality. They go out of their way to study guest details and make them feel at home in Marta's. We came in a big group. But joanna, andy and her team of well drilled staff made sure we have every wish attended to. In the event that they could not, which by the way wasn't much, they apologized profusely \u0026 explained the reasons for doing so. Joanna \u0026 her husband, the owners have other hotels in the island. And one of them is the rinjani lodge at the foot of mount rinjani in close proximity to the famous sendang gila \u0026 tiu kelep waterfalls. Have a look at it also, i'm confident that the hotel would also have an equal, if not better service standard compared to this one. We would love to give it a try next time we come to this beautiful \u0026 natural island paradise of lombok. Unfortunately i do not have a picture of the hotel on my phone but i do have a picture of our happy family on bikes at a nearby beach arranged by andy from the front desk. Keep up the good work, joanna. You're doing a fine job. Of all the places i've visited before, i would give this place my top 3 in terms of service standard, value for money \u0026 location. It is nicely located near the party area (but not noisy) but also to the jetty, harbour, night food market \u0026 loads of restaurant choices. We will definitely come here again, without a doubt."}

We drove here, so not much problems to move around. Plenty of restaurants around the area. Muslim travellers have plenty of options over here. The owner, Mommy Noi \u0026 her 2 sons were fantastic. They are (especially mommy) generous and would cater for our every request and enquiry. I would like to compliment her staff, San Ma as well. She tried hard to give us the best possible service. On new year's eve, the family arranged for a pool barbeque party complete with baloons \u0026 flying tanglungs. It was indeed an awesome experience to celebrate with them and other hotel guests. What a superb opportunity it was to meet other guests fr other countries and make friends with them. The food during the bbq was delicious as well.

Easy to do banking, locating cheap food (at the pantip market and other stalls), renting motorbikes \u0026 other stuff here. Service was shocking at first. Maybe because we arrived late ie 9pm on xmas day. May have caught the reception fella on a bad day. He Requested to hold our passports or thb2k as a deposit. The manner in which he showed us the room was as if everything here is chargeable if we damaged it. A listing of prices for the items available to use \u0026 warned us of hair coloring effect on their bedsheets. He looked concerned as well that we brought our child although advertisements have indicated that this is a child friendly place. It was either him or a case of loss in translation?Internet service wasn't always smooth but the biggest complaint we had was the availability of hot water. It kept on failing and we probably annoyed him by calling 3 times on the 1st night to get the shower sorted. He pointed out on his 3rd visit that it could be because we were using too much power causing the failure. All we had on was a multi socket for phone charging. Thankfully, the problem was solved the following day as a mechanic was called in to resolve the issue. Another thing was that we used the pool on our 3rd day but disappointed to see the caretaker's dog having a drink on the same pool while me \u0026 son were bathing. Note that we are muslim travellers. My tip for muslim travellers is that there is a muslim restaurant near the big c supermarket in town. It is open fr noon to late every day. All in all i wouldn't stay here again. Staff needs a customer service course. They give better deals at the lovely seaview haad yao or haad son resorts on the west of this island. Better deals thru walk in as some are not listed on agoda or the other internet booking sites."}

Basic facilities are all available. Toilets are clean. Toilet cleanliness is basically our main priority when looking for a hotel/apartment to stay. Some rooms have fan while others don't.We paid for an extra person, so the hotel put in an extra double bed on top of the one already available. Ms Linda showed and brought us to our room.The eletricity service left much to be desired. Not allowed to use high consuming eletricals such as rice cooker, water heater or hairdryer. I believe this is due to the limited capacity of the power generator at the hotel. Signage pertaining to this is shown near the front desk but it inconvinienced us greatly, more so because we brought our toddler who demands milk every few hours and our preference for instant noodles :).Breakfast was decent. Normal spread with main dishes of fried rice or noodles or kuay teow. As a local traveller, i feel that the hotel could have improvised on this by offering the popular nasi lemak or other famous local delicacies such as nasi dagang or nasi berlauk. We feel that the hotel may be keeping the menu simple as it looked the same from day to day.The hotel beach was good but somewhat limited. Tuna bay beach next to us is broader and have nice white sand, but on busy days, we were not allowed to hang around or bath there as it was claimed private. They have many tourists themselves and thus we had to move further left nearer to the marine park jetty. But the whole coast in this part of perhentian besar is beautiful and offers many good spots to snorkel without having to pay extra for a boat ride.The restaurant is one of the main attraction of this place. Unfortunately there was an unpleasant event during our first dinner on Saturday 12th Sept 2015. 2 male staff in charge of seafood barbeque were pretty rude. They may have been busy handling a group order that night but the least they can do is answer us properly sinece we as paying guests. The perpetrators are a dark malay guy and a glum looking \u0026 silent chinese guy. The kelantanese and terengganu people have much to learn about customer service from their thai counterparts north of the border. We have been to koh samui, phuket and krabi before and have never encountered such rudeness.On the last night, we had a birthday dinner at the restaurant and was served way better than the other day. Food came fast. The recommended dishes are the Seabass 3 rasa and the breaded fried calamari with sweet thai chilli sauce. Watermelon juice is pretty good too. Special mention to tall dark and handsome hotel waiter/worker Encik Wan for handling our orders that night superbly.Earlier in the day, he also took some time to bring bananas \u0026 show some squirrel feeding to my toddler son.Finally, credit should go where credit is due. Ms Linda at the front desk/reception is the outstanding staff attending each matter dilligently and satisfactorily. We broke our hot water flask and she insisted it was ok. But we proceeded to replace it anyway.The lady owner was also helpful. She upgraded our room once a sea view room became available. she even gave us the option of choosing between 2 rooms and alternative locations. for this gesture made us appreciate the hotel more."}

My stay was short, i found waterfront more than sufficient for my stay. The service here is warm. I used to stay here for 9 weeks in 2011. Surprised to find that some hotel staff still recognised me. Service level was pretty good. The food spread, although less than dl, is sufficient. Rendang was a little oily but they have nasi lemak and egg station too. The sambal is slightly inferior but i guess it would be nitpicking to say that. Service at the cafe was warm too. Met some ppl fr the labuan market and some fr outside. Had a nice chat with them and made some friends. Ujana is a short walk away. And so is the taxi service. Taxi is also on call at the hotel. So distance \u0026 accesibility is not a problem.

Booked the 2 bedroom apartment immediately.Arrived late as the event finished late. There were a couple of rooms available, so asked the girl for a more scenic room rather than the 8th floor apartment she intended to give us. Alas, we were given the room on the 17th floor with a view of the Penang Bridge and Pulau Jerjak.We liked the hotel! the view was good and was extremely pleased to discover they had refurbished the apartment too. Came here in 2009 or 2010 but was rather unimpressed back then. I suppose any recently renovated hotel gives a rather diffent feel to the tenants.Almost everyone enjoyed the hotel and we took some good pictures here too.As i took the non breakfast option, had to go down and buy breakfast for the gang. Encik Lan at the front door gave us directions to the original kayu restaurant nearby. his advise was that the restaurant was so near we wouldn't even break sweat. He was right. And the roti canai \u0026 teh tarik served here was pretty damn good.At the room, there weren't any plates. So we requested for some plates from the front desk. They entertained our request and we had a good penang style roti canai breakfast that day. Even brought back 3 teh tarik packets for gd measure.All in all it was a good booking. Planning to book again somewhere in Oct or November this year with the family members,Nothing negative to review apart from some dusts nearby the tv cabinet area. Seeing that the room is clean, it is probably dust gathered over the last few days as i predict the room is clean but no tenants for a couple of days.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Choose a high floor overlooking the sea, bridge and jerjak island\nSee more room tips"}

It was a short business trip as i had a seminar at a hotel nearby during the 21st. That hotel was fully booked during the date concerned. Turns out that there was an asia africa conference in jakarta \u0026 bandung that week, so a couple of top rated hotels were fully booked. Checked in late on tuesday 21st as we took a late flight fr KL to Jakarta. Flight was delayed a good 45 minutes too so we ended up arriving very late here. The good part of arriving late is that bags were cleared very fast, taxi was available and no traffc jam (macet) to the hotel. Took us half an hour to reach the hotel. At the hotel, check in was easy and as requested, we got a room facing the main Sudirman road and a higher floor. I think the jakarta traffic and nearby buildings make for a better view than having a view of other buildings close up. Good tip by travel advisor!The hotel room was not spacious but the room had all the basics you would need. You may need to call housekeeping to request for iron, ironing board and some toiletries. I arrived late and was too tired to iron so i asked for the VIP pressing service to allow me to wear my crumpled shirt for the training in a few hours time. Bed was very comfy and i had a quality sleep. Awakened at 6.30 am to the jakarta traffic sounds. Funny that at 1am when i arrived, the road was almost completely deserted. Breakfast was sufficient. On my 1st day, they served nasi goreng with other standard hotel menu and on the 2nd day, it was buttered rice with soto ayam with the other stuff remaining the same. If i had stayed in the same hotel for a week, i would prob get bored with the breakfast. But here i was staying here for 2 days and enjoyed my breakfast experience throughly. The best thing about the hotel is it's close proximity to 2 huge shopping malls, Grand Indonesia \u0026 Plaza Indonesia. There are many other places to visit here as the sudirman main road provided for a great platform to travel places. Getting a taxi was easy. You can flag one by the roadside or ask the concierge guys to do it. Grand Indonesia was so near that you don't require a taxi to go there, unless you hate the fumes and pollution. We visited hard rock cafe Jakarta at Pacific Place (another good mall!) and it was probably on the same main road. I wanted nasi padang for lunch and the taxi brought me to the sederhana restaurant which was near to the pacific place. Try this itinirerary if you guys plan to catch a souvenier at HRC and enjoy some quality indonesian food nearby. Tanah Abang market is nearby this hotel and it took ya 10-20 mins to get there. Managed to buy all the textile and clothing required for our next few festivities and wedding invitations. There are a huge range to choose from and prices are negotiable. On the last day after check out, my luggage was safely kept by the front desk staff as i had a couple of hours to kill while waiting for my evening taxi for flight to the airport.Overall, i had a short but hugely satisfying trip to Jakarta. Thank you HIE for providing the base for an efficient outing. I would definitely stay here again next time."}

Walking distance to a couple more restaurants, blue wave cafe and other amenities. Food choice at the brassieri is ample but quality of cooking is not of KL standard. However, food are relatively fresh, esp seafood. In Labuan, the standard of freshness is high due to the island nature and location. Had steam siakap during the lunch buffet today and the quality is as good as anywhere. The rooms are nice and spacious and the wifi is free, but speed of internet leaves a lot to be desired. Normally i have a favourite room location here and will try to get the same room area whichever the floor is. Hint: my room is 404 .The bar here is pretty decent and drinks are cheap in line with the island's tax free status. Of course the hotel prices are higher than elsewhere but still cheaper than kl drink prices. The lounge is seaview and it's relaxing to chill during sunset time.

Since i'm a member of the hilton club, i decided to use the voucher entitlement to spend my 5th yr anniversary dinner here. The booking was easily made thru the club and although booked just 2-3 wks earlier, and during the start of the school holidays, the dates were available. The room was nice and clean. More for couples and small families as there were some sharp edges unsuitable for children. The bathroom was transparent from the bed side but shutter/roller allows it to be opened and closed depending on what you fancy. This gave a nice high tech edge to the room. The bathroom rain shower is pretty good and i aleays enjoy bathrooms with rain shower. It's the satisfaction enjoyed during shower when plentiful amounts of water comes down like rain. Mind you it was pretty dry season in KL during march. The view was not so great. A view of the building next door and jalan damai behind jalan tun razak did not make for good viewing. Since i got this room on a complimentary basis, i guess i'll not complaim too much about the viewTv channels were ample and we caught up with one or two good movies during our stay. Given the king size beds given, and tv in front of it, it was really cozy to tuck in a couple of hours under the sheets watching a nice show in between meals or after waking up pre breakfast. All in all, i would say that one great thing about the hotel is it's location. There are some good shops in the intermark mall where the hotel is situated. You can get your grocery stuff at village grocer, coffee at san francisco and other coffee joints, sports shopping at the recently open sports direct store and plenty more. We had dinner at red lobster for the first time since it opened here in KL. I had planned to go many times but staying here in hilton double tree gave me an excellent opportunity to do so and boy did we have an awesome seafood dinner that night. A new club just opened next door to red lobster and it looks quite happening \u0026 grandThe hotel is also close to the ampang park lrt and the ampang park mall. Altho the mall is dated, you can just take the train to klcc one stop away. Parking was enough and you could also easily flag a taxi to go anywhere from this very central location in kl.Overall i would stay here again and recommend others to come give it a try."}

Guess i must hv spent too much time visiting french boutique shops in champs elysse or at galerie lafayette . Glad i came this time and wouldn't mind visiting here again."}

Went to Bicester Village on the 22nd december. So, i'm entitled to an opinion and to make comparisons. The great thing about La Vallee is that it is connected with the main line of RER A heading to the same direction as disneyland. This makes it so much more accessible unlike BV which requires a separate train system fr marylebone to bicester north. La vallee village is a mall's walk away fr the station which means it offers mall shopping ie a little extra for people who don't enjoy outlet shopping. The mall is fairly huge too with auchan and a large sports shop inside. In between the mall \u0026 la vallee, i was informed there is a good churros stall but we missed it as our toddler was having tantrums (too long shopping time by the adults?) . A good advantage of la vallee is the french outlets such as longchamp, miu miu and the others. This was unavailable in the english outlets. No LV here but i'll suggest champs elysees and galerie la fayette for that. Longchamp has gd value though limited stock. I spend quite a bit in ralph lauren as there was no queue here unlike the BV one so choosing and lining up to try clothes at the changing room was not a major hassle. Wifey found plenty of good deals abd bought loads in tissots, furla \u0026 longchamp. Overall i would definitely go again, although if only for the french brands and easiness to reach"}

Chose to omit the iconic 26th as the crowd is too large, long queues everywhere, tough parking and jammed town. Given the circumstances, 22nd was our choice of course. Buying train tickets not difficult fr london (marylebone). Just go online and buy chiltern rail return ticket with shuttle coverage fr bicester north to shopping heaven ie village. Also, having visited La Vallee on the 17th dec, i feel i have the right to compare these 2 outlets. As a guy even, i felt there were good deals everywhere. I did not go thru all the shops but ferragamo, hugo boss \u0026 coach had very attractive deals! Wanting to stretch my budget, ferragamo was the place i chose to spent my limited dollar in . But the trip back was not pleasant as i also kept thinking of the boss \u0026 coach items. Would have bought it had it not been in the same category of items as SF. Since i went to ralph lauren in vallee and spent a small fortune over there, i didn't go in to the one in BV. The queues i read on trip advisor of the PRL shop in BV is absolutely correct. No such queue in La Vallee. That may also mean that BV may have had the better deals but i care less now that i have bought more than 5 shirts in the parisian outlet. My wife informed me that prada \u0026 burberry also had good stuff here. Only longchamp and a few french brands are therefore worth buying in la vallee. So go here if u have to make a choice. No LV shops in both FO's, i'm afraid. Toilets were available and shuttle servive to the train was always there. Facility fr VAT refunds too if you're non EU so no complains. Reasonable eateries include pret a manger \u0026 a crepe shop. Thai busaba looked affordable too but we chose for 100% shopping time as we brought our owned packed lunch cooled all the wat fr our bayswater apartment. Definitely will come again, with extra ammunition and better know hows, of course."}

The restaurant staff from philipines was quite accomodative in taking our photos when requested.The food selection was plentiful. A few of the staff also sent some food to our table. We got a beef rib dish, i think it was chinese cooking, 2 roast duck popiahs and rendang beef ribs. I have never eaten beef ribs cooked this way, so i must say it was quite delicious and a whole new experience for us.Out of the dishes they serve, i took the roast duck, the indian bryani with lamb korma and the cheese cake + vanilla ice cream for dessert. All of them were good except for the cake which i felt was a bit too rich for my liking. The teh tarik at the drinks counter was also nice. I believe they used cow milk for thisBut overall, i would say the price of 100+ per person for the buffet is quite pricey considering that there wasn't much expensive dishes; no oyster, no drinks(apart fr teh tarik), etc. But everywhere around the restaurant, the staff were all friendly and were very eager to serve.I would recommend people to come here for the ramadan buffet or for people eager to look for a large selection of food."}

We were however a bit dissapointed with the breakfast arrangements. The cafe could not accomodate so many tenants on a weekend and hence we were pushed by hotel staff to eat at the ballroom. The ballroom was nice and spacious with plenty of room, but lacked the spirit of having breakfast in a hotel. I believe that the choices and variety wasn't as much as the hotel cafe. It was more the ambience and feel of a wedding rather than the cosy breakfast environment expected by season travellers.The parking of the hotel is shared with mall visitors. hence i feel that parking was less secure than if it was exclusively a hotel parking area.Pool was nice though.

Nothing to complain about as there were plenty of birds inside. Variety is good and there were a few species allowed to roam freely with us visitors. My kid, being a toddler, likes the small colourful parrots at the parrot section. They have nice colours and the birds looked friendly.We missed the show as we came in a bit later in the evening, but there were enough birds to keep us entertained. It was a good experience but i don't see myself visiting again unless i have bird loving guests from abroad.I see the park is also adequately maintained and there were food available for us tourists. The price was however, higher than outside shops which is actually understandable. Because of this, we only bought some basic stuff during our 2-3 hours here."}

Found out from the helpful staff that this bungalow was a location frequently used for local movies and dramas. Sleep was lovely as the healthy air and coolness here made it a pleasant resting place. Sitting outside sipping cofffee by the pool out in the open was excellent too. On the down side, we found the road leading up to it to be particularly treacherous. Some work needs to be done to repair it. The infinity pool was a beauty but not swimmable as the water was not very clean. Water heater in the shower room was not very hot.

Having driven all the way from Malaysia to Koh Samui for the first time, we arrived slightly tired. It felt wonderful when we reached the hotel as it was pretty, stylishly designed and the staff friendly. What we noticed is most guests were wearing big smiles on their faces with the warm interaction between hotel personnel and inmates clearly evident. As we brought our 11 month baby along, some reshuffling of furniture and fittings were required, as was some mosquito repellant due to the weather and our ground floor location close to the ponds. Thankfully the staff were receptive to our every demand. FYI, according to the girl at the front desk, a move to another room would not help as the room were all designed in the same way.We loved the location and It was great that there was a good massage parlour nearby (we visited the place everyday!) and many days spent relaxing at the pool (Tip 1: try the hammock by the pool) and the beachfront. (Tip 2: The Tom Yam Goong at the cafe is a must try. Better than all the Tom Yam's we've had at Thailand and Malaysia.). The best room locations are by the pool,. try and get these rooms if they are available. The free shutter to Chaweng was also useful. We used it once and the Big Horn Restaurant in Chaweng nearby the London Bus drop off point is worth a mention for it's superbly grilled fish.Special mention to Punnpreeda staff, Mr Ohm who was helpful throughout with his insightful tips. Managed to locate muslim food traders a few meters away and a muslim market nearby due to his assistance. He even drew a map so that we would not get lost finding Raja Ferry Port during our last day. Would recommend this place to everyone and love to return to this lovely and charming hotel one day.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Choose low floors for the old and elderly as this resort does not have a lift.

What a lovely place to fish, relax, play in the sand with kids, and feel like your in some kind of prison. Spoke to one of the caretakers who said \"I do patrols during darkness and if your too noisy, you'll get a warning then out with no refund(edited version).\" ... Sorry teenagers, still have to go to bed with fat cat! I got the chat as 2 blokes (not from my camp) sat outside my unit having a chat(no music) after I arrived....... And I went to bed at 8pm with my 2 toddlers but copped the blame for keeping the caravan park awake. Apart from that particularly rude munchkin, Other staff do patrols during day and night on an electric golf cart, staring into your site to catch you out. Beware. But if you do go, lovely beach which goes for km's each way. Spectacular scenery.I am not saying all staff in this blog are in the 'warden like' category, but with some others even a smile went a stray. (Btw there are nice staff there too who this doesn't apply to). I'd definitely like to go again one day, but not under the current caretakers."}

One of the places that we have enjoyed the most was the visit to the Universal Studios. Indeed, the place was very inviting. This amusement place made me bring myself to my childhood. The venue was not just for children to enjoy but also for the adults to make memories with family and friends.In reference to cleanliness and orderliness, its truly amazing that you can never see litter around. The staff/ employees were very accommodating and friendly. The service was excellent.

Cleverly designed storage and modern controls of lighting and A/C make this somewhat the ultimate travel room. It's very small and compact, but most things you need are there and in turn with the small size of the room the cost is much less than staying in hotels of similar standards. The staff were friendly, check in Easy. The one criticism I would give is that each day they would take away the two towels we had used and then leave only one...a mystery to me, you can call reception via the phone app as the room does not have a phone. Overall I enjoyed the stay as the location is great next to the station and the price was good."}

This is one of those places, having been vegetarian for 8 months now it's sometimes difficult to find restaurants that offer tasty food that isn't just a Salad! At Levi's there is a good range of options, I had the Jerk Mushrooms to start with which really were delicious the portion size was good and the Roti bread that it was served with was really tasty. For my Main I had the Halloumi burger with Sweet Potato fries, again a tasty option, good size and nice dressing. The service was good, I visited at lunch so it wasn't that busy, but the food arrived quick. The restaurant is relatively good Value for a Starter, Main and a soft drink it was £22 so not the cheapest place to eat, but good as a treat."}

The only item I had a problem with were the Yorkshire Puddings which were so oily that I left them, but maybe this was a one off. We will visit again i'm sure."}

The restaurant itself is compact-so book in advance as it gets busy! They have recently added an outdoor area to the front which is great in the summer months. The menu has a great selection of dishes, and a good amount of vegetarian options. Daily specials are posted on the board and a nice dessert cabinet hosts a selection of delicious looking cakes. The food comes out when ready and you never feel rushed which is nice. The service is just as good as the food which makes the whole restaurant work like clockwork. As it mainly opens for daytime offerings, they do open slightly later at the weekends which is nice. It would be great if they opened later all week round, but I guess when you have something that works and is busy then why change! We will be back soon."}

The burgers were not so good-slightly overdone and a big lack of any quantity of garnish/sauce. As a vegetarian they allowed me to have the Sweet Potato and bean burger as part of the set menu. I know this is a steakhouse, but they could do more for vegetarians as the set menu really did lack any choices as there was only one main, something I hope they will change in the future.

In the two days we walked along the wall we must have only seen 30 other people. It felt like we had the entire wall to ourselves. Sonia was great at answering any questions we had before and from the pickup to the drop-off back in Beijing the whole experience was fantastic. We had good weather and could see the stars in the evening, and breathtaking views of the wall in the daytime. The equipment provided was all in great condition and the food was also excellent. It was nice that we didn't feel rushed and everybody got chance to make there own experience. I would recommend packing light! the camping equipment although not massively heavy still add's to the already tough walk up the wall in places, but the views are the reward! Take a camera! I took my drone to fly and got some amazing footage and had plenty of time to do this and take photos once at the camping area."}

There was a busy crowd at the top and with such large amount of people and children the windows were really dirty. Don't go up the tower if it's not a really clear day as the view won't be good at all.

The rooms are really hot, if you like a nice cool room overnight then you may find that you will struggle to sleep as although the rooms have individual air conditioning panels the system is centrally controlled and doesn't cool the rooms much lower than 24 degrees. The bed is comfy and furnishings although slightly dated are in good condition. Although smoking is banned in the hotel several guests still seem to smoke indoors, and the hotel don't seem that bothered. Wifi is terrible, don't expect to get any work done that involves using the internet, if this is crucial then stay in a different hotel. The breakfast is nice, plenty of hot options and cold juices and an egg station.

It's rare to find such quality dinning that offers this. The restaurant has a great feel and the music is at a perfect level so that you can still enjoy a conversation but not so quiet that there is no atmosphere. The views from the outside balcony are also great and perfect for a photo of Pudong. There is a great late night set menu of two or three courses, and the options are plentiful. Drink options were also great and buy one get one free on Cocktails at night. My main criticism and the one thing thats lost the extra rating is that there are no vegetarian options on the set menu for the main course. This is disappointing from a restaurant of this type. I would like to visit again to try the full menu."}

I actually contacted the restaurant via email to let them know my comments, however they didn't even bother to respond. First impressions were good, we were shown to a lovely table by the window which did have great views, unfortunately from this point onwards the experience wasn't good at all. After eventually ordering after waiting forever for the waiter, our starters arrived, both very pleasant. Once the starters were finished we ventured outside to take some photos, but were surprised when we returned that the plates had not been cleared. We then sat for at least another 15 minutes with the empty starter plates in front to the point where the main course arrived and the waiter had to take it back as there was no room on the table to put it down, he then cleared the plates and set the main course out. My partner had been given a bred knife for the lamb dish and again the wait to get this changed seem like forever. The lamb was tough and the portion was small. The waiter also did not suggest any side dishes when he took the order so when the rather small main courses arrived we then needed to order further dishes, only one of these ever turned up and we decided at this point that we wouldn't have a desert as we didn't want to give anymore custom to the restaurant. It seems many people visit here for the view of Pudong which is the best part of this restaurant in my opinion, but I would recommend going elsewhere as the food and the terrible service is not worth the money. The wine selection was good but overall we were really disappointed."}

We made three dishes in the two hour class and we were able to have a large lunch from them and also take one away for eating another time. I can highly recommend, even if in Shanghai for a short time."}

You are guided when you leave the boat by a National Parks Ranger and a conservationist, they both had such an in depth knowledge of the the island. We went into areas that are usually out of bounds to the general public such as the underground communications tunnel, Chapel, industry building and dungeons/solitary confinement cells. I would recommend asking any questions as you walk round as the guides are happy to answer them. Finally the tour finishes and you then get chance to go on the main cell house audio tour. The audio guide is brilliant and what is good is that it covers different topics that haven't been covered on the behind the scenes bit. I would recommend this tour to anybody who has a serious interest on the history of the island and Prison."}

The museum has many items on display from the family's own collection and articles on loan from The Walt Disney Company. Many of the exhibits are interactive and you can take in as little or as much as you like from the vast amount of content. Definitely more suited to adults than children I would say. Slightly pricy at $25 but still was good for the couple of hours we were there. Also a nice gift shop at the end with various limited edition items."}

I'm a vegetarian so I was really happy to see many dishes that were meat free. I was shocked to see the restaurant almost full when we arrived just 20mins after opening, so we had high expectations at that point. We ordered the new potatoes, cheese quesadilla, plantain and Vegetable paella. The dishes come when they are ready and first to arrive was the quesadilla it was fantastic and I can certainly recommend the potatoes and plantain followed equally delicious and finally the Paella, it was only when halfway through the dish that we discovered some bits of bacon. I was really disappointed and called over one of the staff to explain. He in turn called the manager who did apologise right away and went directly to the kitchen to find out what had happened, he removed the cost of the dish from the bill. I guess everybody has a mishap once in a while so I was still really pleased overall with the rest of the food and service. I would recommend 3 or 4 dishes per two people for a good amount of food. The sangria sold in either glasses, half or full jugs is also nice. Worth a stop here for tasty food."}

We went with a run of the house room, but like many hotels in Vegas they give you the option to upgrade on arrival-we paid an extra $10 to have a royal room which was newly decorated. You can bargain with the check in staff for the best price on the upgrade-don't pay the first price they say! It was clean and tidy and the bed was comfortable. The casino area of the hotel is nice and well set out. Location the hotel is close to other big names such as New York New York and MGM you can easily walk down the strip from here, catch a bus or get the tram/monorail. They charge $8 for parking per night. The resort fees are worth taking a note of if you are booking a room in Vegas these vary depending on the hotel you choose and some are more than others Excalibur charges $33 which is certainly on the high side, but the rooms are cheap in comparison to others, so it balances out."}

We had already pre-booked online and I would recommend this if you want to get a slot as they sell out and are unlikely to be available on the day. Once arrived you collect wristbands from the collection point and from there onwards expect to queue for around an hour before you are actually clipped onto the line and on your way down Fremont street. The attraction is well organised and clean, and I guess the queues only exist because it is popular. If you have small loose objects such as hats, glasses or handbags they provide you with a special bag that clips on the line with you. If you need to wear glasses for the experience then bring a strap for them as you have to purchase one if not. The flight itself is fantastic, much better to do it in the evening to get the full experience from the lights on the led screen. It's out of town from the Vegas strip and a taxi will cost around $22 so getting there can be expensive or a bus for $6 there are casinos and other things to see, so you can spend a couple of hours looking around. If rated this only three stars as it is expensive for the short time you are on the line and the fact it's out of town adds to the cost."}

There are no lockers available pre security-so if there is something you are not allowed to take in you are faced with a difficult decision, either dispose of it or waste part of your day returning it to your hotel or car. Fair enough you can check the rules and terms and conditions before turning up, which I would advise if you have any sort of large luggage or camera equipment. The park was fairly busy and we visited on a Wednesday, I would avoid the weekends or school holidays. I would recommending using the free Fast Pass service for the most popular rides or you will have long queue's. Ask the Guest Services about where the characters will be this will save you time looking around for them. The Photo Pass that they offer for $78 is really good value-you get digital downloads of all of the photos taken throughout the day including ride photos, which is really good. Many rides were closed for refurbishment but that didn't stop us from having a great day. The corn on the cob's are really tasty."}

The staff in the hotel are very friendly and well mannered. However I did have some problems with my room. The taps seem to have a mind of their own and sometimes the cold doesn't work at all, especially if the shower is running or the toilet has been flushed. I spoke to reception on numerous occasions-I even asked to move room which wasn't possible so I decided to just put up with it despite the several attempts that they made to fix the problem. The light switches in the rooms are ridiculous, very old fashioned and every light has to be switched off individually (I have seven switches!) I am told that the superior rooms don't have this problem. The breakfast is lacking which is a shame as the room service and other dinning is excellent. The pool area is nice and the bar on level 27 is also great it has good views although the service is extremely slow. Good luck in the elevators as you need to insert your room key and it often takes several attempts....even the staff get annoyed with it. The hotel feels very safe and secure and everybody gets security scanned and searched on entry. Overall the hotel is in a good location with many amenities expected from this level of hotel. I would like to try one of the superior rooms to see the difference as the standard rooms are now quite dated. I've only down rated this hotel due to the problems with the taps in the room which was never fully rectified, I would have liked to have seem this addressed further, especially given the amount of time spent in the hotel."}

Sadly it wasn't half as good as the original. Perhaps the lack of colonial charm is what create an almost clinical atmosphere in the hotel, not much warmth. I was here for the afternoon tea and as part of a large group we were all expecting great things. Sadly the service was terrible, it took so long to serve anything! Even water at the table took a good 40 mins before we even got to eating of drinking any tea! The buffet style food was lacking in Savoury items and I left feeling like I had eaten a bag of sugar. Not the usual standards I would expect of such a prestigious chain."}

The studio tour is nothing compared to the Warner Bros tour, it feels more like a ride than an insight into the world of film and TV. The theme park lacks big attractions for the amount of visitors and queue times are very long. We went to queue for the Harry Potter ride however my backpack could not fit in the small lockers that are provided so we had to ride separately while we each watched the bags. It was absolutely ridiculous that this hasn't been thought about. The park was so busy it made it almost unbearably and we actually left earlier than planned. The special effects show is worth a watch and the Mummy ride is good. Hopefully they will expand the park further to accommodate the large amount of visitors."}

We found the Doublegem, however it was extremely expensive compared to other alternatives that were already booked up. We did read some reviews before we went, however I must say that if you have stayed in other places in the Philippines it really isn't as bad as it's made out on here. The staff were friendly, pool was nice and the view combined with the location is ok. You can get a Trike into the main town for 50peso, where you can find lots of restaurants and bars. The rooms are basic and internet is lacking/not reliable, but it's clean and has good aircon. There can be some noise from the Chickens outside, but it all adds to the local feel. The onsite bar and restaurant is nice. I don't think the hotel deserves some of the negative reviews i've seen.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Sea view rooms are nice, hill/road side are slightly noisy from traffic and chicens\nSee more room tips"}

I really liked this place... the swimming pool is awesome and free inhouse movies in your room is mind blowing. The collection of movies are also very good and new. I liked the friendly staff of Hard Rock Hotel and their dress. Late evening one can spend good time at Hard Rock Café where live band performs( they have two one inside hotel and one outside). Do remember to check reception about activities as lot of them are there for kids like foam party, beach volley ball, rock climbing etc. In total its a good deal for family vacation as its near to all the major restaurants like starbucks, mc Donald, KFC and Kuta Beach - (all time dirty beach). We were family of 4 adults 2 kids and one infant. We hired a pvt driver called Rudy, he has a SUV (Toyota) if anyone is looking for an honest and expert driver reach out to him +62-815-5800-7247. You can whtsapp him as generally connections are not that strong here. Give my reference he will give you discount. One request to hard rock management - Please buy steam press for your in house guest. Its a beautiful property but your housekeeping guys informed us that hard rock has only normal iron(which I haven't used in last 15 yrs). I guess its tme to upgrade.\n\n\nRoom Tip: There are not sea facing room in this property\nSee more room tips"}

I chose to do the PADI E-Learning to maximise my time in the area and to do all the theory at my own pace online. It's a great option in my mind and was swiftly organised for me by the owner Filip. The practical side of the course was excellent, Pot my instructor took the time to explain everything in good detail and made sure I was happy and confident in the water. It was a great experience overall, it's given me the skills to progress further with my diving and I would love to return again in the future."}

Just what the doctor ordered on the cold December afternoon. Well prepared wholesome food, provided in a warm, welcoming, chic setting. On arriving you are immediately immersed in a grand art nouveau salon. Spread over three floors with Doric columns and glass paneled ceilings, I imagine a visit at any time of the year would leave any guest already impressed. Beyond the architectural beauty of this, from the outside, modest gem, it was clear to us that there had been a great deal of effort made to apply the appropriate festive trimming for the season. The garlands, fairy lights and other decorations were truly delightful. We took our seats in the back of the restaurant, through a largely camp curtain, where the tables we’re suited more to dining than the high tables and stools of the salon. Still feeling very plush the area we were seated had a much lower ceiling, a feel which was a lot cosier than the more open spaces of the venue. Although the lighting throughout does create a very intimate and romantic ambience. The waiter was very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable of the menu and maintained a good balance of being informative and friendly without imposing on our meal. The AppetiserBuffalo Wings with Cucumber and Blue Cheese Mayo and Soup du Jure (vegetable) served with home made Brown Bread. EntréeLunch special, and a steal at only €10.00Confit of Duck Leg served on a bed of Dauphinois with Red Cabbage and Gravy. All around well presented and delicious. Drinks were a little more expensive than I would have expected as we only had soft drinks, the starters were reasonably priced for the portion size and quality. On the whole I would say that including the ‘Lunch Special’, Café en Seine offers a great dining experience, great value for money and adequately appeased our appetites without leaving us feeling overdone.This Elegant art nouveau bar, offers an exceptional quality dining experience, hosted in a unique and comforting setting by a well informed service team. If you’re looking for somewhere to lunch, perhaps a location for the perfectly romantic dinner date or even a drink after a day in the office, Café en Seine is guaranteed to give you an experience you’ll never forget.A must for all food and drink lovers. You will be looking for your next excuse to visit."}

You'll have the chance to pour your own pint of the famous black stuff for yourself and even a lesson in how to taste it. Don't forget to check the notice board in the transport room for special 'Brewers Project' taste times. A visit to the gravity bar is a must and is included in the admission price. The views over Dublin are excellent, and the perfect place to end your day. All round a great attraction. I would try and leave a good three hours to complete the tour. If you are a Guinness fan there is a great gift shop on the ground floor which sells a large range of exclusive items."}

It was a Monday evening so we didn't think it would be that busy, but on arrival it was clear that we should have made a reservation. The wait time for a table was an hour, not that much of a problem as being set in the middle of temple bar there are plenty of places to go and have a drink to pass the time. If possible I would defiantly remmed booking in advance to avoid disappointment. Returning to the restaurant which was absolutely packed, we were welcomed by the very friendly staff. It wasn't hard to see what the restaurant is famous for, as baskets of Chicken Wings seemed to be a staple on almost every table. We ordered a basket to share, easily enough for two people, as a starter. They were simply delicious, plenty of chicken on all of the wings, covered with a zingy spiced buffalo style sauce, but just enough to warm your tastebuds and served with creamy sauce. For the mains we had burgers which were equally were fantastic. Medium cooked they were juicy and delicious with a pink centre, clearly good quality Irish beef. We can also recommend the fruit Soda's, I had the Strawberry which was very refreshing. All together a great restaurant, with a longstanding reputation for great service and food. Set in the heart of Temple Bar, it's a nice escape from the surrounding tourists traps. We highly recommend a visit."}

The staff were freindly and helpful, however they did not point out the lunchtime special which if i was made aware would have fully taken up. Restaurant was clean and tidy."}

No doubt its a must visit property but you need atleast 2 days to enjoy the nature. Transport team is amazing and their cost is very reasonable as compared to other transport operators whose only agenda is to loot customer. Imp point for travellers this property is in GOA so if anyone says they have to pay Karnataka state tax then pls avoid. The entry of this property is from GOA but some part of property lies in Maharashtra and Karnataka. If you are going with small kids then pls do keep odomos and mosquitos patches as this is inside a jungle. Do try their BAR its very reasonable. Lastly there is ZERO phone signals so bring your own satellite phones if you have to make urgent call. Overall a very nice experience"}

We got decent rooms near pool. Overall our experience was good since the accessibility to beach is from the property itself. One of my friend noticed that there is a cremation ground just opposite the entry of the hotel but it is not visible. I found that service people try very hard to meet the demand of the guest which is a positive sign. We asked for mosquitto replent and spray in our room which is arranged in no time. Even at midnight they helped us with medical emergency 5 star for that too. Since this is near beach lot of dust come over but sweeper and cleaning staff do their best to keep the property clean so no complaints on that. I had a problem with Reservation team no one served us welcome drink , we all 4 couple checked in at different time and none of us got the welcome drink. We booked this hotel through online site and booked room on daily basis for 3 nights as it was cheaper. Somehow one of my friend erreneously booked one room with single occupancy and hotel charged exorbitant price for double occupancy which spoiled our mood. There is no connectivity of mobile signals in this hotel, although this is a problem with whole Calangute area. Last but not least food is good. Overall i will give 3.5 rating to this hotel."}

After checking there online booking system we found we had been overcharged $80, but no explanation from them and there was no way in hell they were going to reimburse us. Bins were not emptied for three days, there was rubbish all over the ground and maggots on the bins. We were also not allowed more than one car at our campsite even though we paid an absolute fortune for our 4m x 4m dirt patch. They have left an extremely bad impression on us and there is no way in hell we will be back. We love Yamba and will be finding somewhere else to stay when we return."}

Location is awesome facing nagin lake and hari parbat. Enjoy evening tea or morning tea at their huge garden. They have two chefs who are with them for 15-20 yrs and i must say each dish they prepare has his own kashmiri taste. For non vegetarians its the only place to eat. Best of luck to you guys who are doing such a wonderful job and keeping the place intact after so much of damage during the flood. I will come soon.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Lake facing obviously but its not reserved for anyone\nSee more room tips"}

The first time i had the mexican schnitzel and unfortunately the chicken was very thick, not crunchy and a little dry, however they put nachos on top of chicken - i am most certainly not complaining about that! The chips served with the chicken were crunchy however the chicken just made the meal not so awesome. The second time i had the bar nachos and boy do you get what you pay for! The nachos are huge and taste great, i would love to see someone finish them! The wait staff and bar staff are really friendly and every now and then help us out with our trivia answers! Would recommend for a casual night out :)"}

We had a powered campsite, and were really close to the kitchen area. I love that we had sinks to wash up in, a stove and kettle made for really easy cooking which can sometimes be hard when camping - also not having to battle the rain under a tarp while cooking is almost luxury! The bathrooms were clean and tidy however on the last night of our stay something went wrong with the hot water so only a mildly warm/sort of cold shower. It rained most of the time so it was really good to be able to spend our time on the picnic tables under the big covered kitchen area. The dingos were a big pain on our stay - stealing food off the table while my back was turned washing up and constantly harassing us at dinner time. Other than this i would gladly pay to stay here again and would highly recommend it"}

Was such an awesome tool to have with us as it was able to help us book tours and tickets, use google maps and give us discounts. Plus you could make free local and International calls - which was great to phone home with.There is an on-site pool, spa and gym (which we didn't use but look great). If you are leaving early in the morning and need a taxi from the hotel, either book one in advance or go to reception early as there was always a line for the taxi's - and the hotel itself isn't really too close to the city, you can be waiting for a while for a taxi to arrive, it took us about 15 minutes to get to the front of the queue.

I ended up going with sweet potato fries and a margarita pizza (which i shared but afterwards wish i didn't so i could have ate the whole thing to myself!) the pizza was spot on, absolutely loved it and the sweet potato fries were Definitely a high point as well. Looking at everyone else's meals that come out, i was glad i got the pizza as they didn't look very appealing. I also didn't like the fact that you had to go to the counter and order, the bar is so packed it is hard to order your dinner. The atmosphere was great though and i had a really good night.

The initial room was a small room with no windows, we were able to upgrade to a city view room with big windows that opened. Room was very large!Only downside to the hotel was the constant smell of cigarette smoke. There is a window in the bathroom that opens to a little gulley that all the bathrooms lead to, so if someone smokes on L1 out the window it drifts up to all the rooms. We had to sleep with the bathroom door shut and a towel over the window - even doing this, waking up in the morning felt like I had smoked a packet in my sleep! There is a restaurant on the top level that had a nice view while enjoying the buffet breakfast in the morning. Went to the restaurant for lunch but it was over priced.

Offering 3 different 1.5 hour cruises, this is a great way to see some of the Gold Coast.Choose from a Morning Cruise, a lunch cruise or an afternoon cruise. We did the morning cruise which was $20 for adults and $18 for concession. This covers a 1.5 hour cruise, tea and coffee and snacks (biscuits and cake) as well as commentary. The captain and staff are friendly and funny making for a very pleasant cruise. It was pouring with rain during our cruise, but this didn't impact the enjoyment at all. You can sit inside, down the bottom undercover or upstairs if you want to brave the weather. We saw all the beautiful luxury homes, learnt a bit about who owned some of them, saw many beautiful boats and even saw a couple of resident eagles in their nest along the river.Drinks were available on board at a cost - soft drinks, beer, wine and even cocktails. Happy hour saw the price of cocktails drop and they were very enjoyable. You even get to keep the plastic glass as a souvenir. The captain also allowed people to come up and sit in the captains chair and steer the ship and get their photo taken.All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our cruise and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone travelling to the Gold Coast."}

I then read some reviews and became a bit worried about what we would find. There is no need to worry!The premises consist of two towers - North and South. We were originally put in the North Tower in a room right next to the lift. Without even going into the room, I went down to see if there was another room we could have as I am a very light sleeper and was worried about the noise from the lifts. Reception kindly moved us to another 2 bedroom ocean view apartment in the South Tower. Room 1225 (this basically means 1 for the South Tower, 22 for the floor and 5 for the room). To say the apartment is spacious would be doing it an injustice! The apartment is huge and you could easily and comfortably stay here for an extended period of time. It is bigger than many peoples homes!Consisting of 2 bedrooms (one with a king bed and the other twin beds), a bathroom, an ensuite, a kitchen, a dining area, a lounge room, a foyer (2nd lounge area) and a large balcony. Both the lounge and the main bedroom have doors leading to the balcony.We were very worried on entering the room as it was very hot. The aircon can actually only do either the living room or the bedrooms, you therefore have to choose which you wanted to cool. For people who hate the heat and humidity, this worried us, but after it had been on for a while, we found that cooling the living room cooled every room down anyway.After spending a couple of nights in the room, I don't believe we would have heard anything if we had remained in the first room as the walls seem to be soundproof. The windows however are not, meaning you can hear sirens, people from the streets below (even from the 22nd floor!) This wasn't much of an issue though.The shower pressure was probably the best shower pressure I've ever had from any hotel all around the world. The bed was also very comfortable. The balcony provided a great view over Surfers Paradise - even though it is situated a couple of blocks from the beach, there were great views of the beach. We were also lucky as our room was on the end of the building and when you walked into the room you are in this little foyer/second lounge area which had floor to ceiling windows out over the Nerang River. As it was raining the whole time we were there (and the balcony was wet and windy, we found ourselves sitting on the sofa and looking out the river side probably more than the beach side! The premises has multiple pools (3 large pools) as well as a spa - which we took advantage of even in the rain. One of them is heated and indoors so there is something for everyone. Also there is a very large gym as well. There are no restaurants/cafes on site, however they are all located within a few minutes walk of the hotel. Right underneath the hotel in the Circle is a Woolworths and a few other shops. The hotel provides free parking for guests in a large car park underneath - you have to go into reception first and then you will be given an access fob and a car space number. This can be quite confusing trying to find your particular space to park in with multiple levels and the numbering not always going sequentially. There are also two lifts, one for the South Tower and one for the North Tower. This was also very confusing and there isn't enough signage to assist guests. The reception can only be accessed via the South Tower. If you are staying in the North Tower then you need to take the lift to level 4 and cross over the walkway to the South Tower lifts and then go down to reception.Also they were doing work in the car park while we were there - I think they were drilling into the concrete and there is apparently major works going on. This means that all the cars get covered in a white powder dust and it is very hard to breathe on the way to the car.All in all, you can't beat the location of these apartments, the space they provide and the comfort for your stay. We will definitely return!\n\n\nRoom Tip: Corner rooms provide a view of 3 sides of the hotel - meaning you get great beach and river views!\nSee more room tips"}

That's why it's a 5.Anyway, the food was delicious. At first, I irked at the idea of itlog na maalat (salted egg) pasta but it was so good. Sisig pizza was also delicious. The staff were also very courteous. They always pay attention, I noticed this as they pour water when your glass is already half-empty.The ambiance has this luxurious feel. It's small but luxurious enough for an ig post.One thing that could be improved is the price. Other meal may be worth around 500 pesos. I could already buy a meal like that in high-end hotels.

The pool was mediocre. It's small and can get crowded easily since people would go here instead of the pricey attractions.Reading the other reviews, it's true that the security here is close to non-existence. I lost my cellphone here. There was no CCTV anywhere. That's why when I asked for help, they couldn't help me about my situation. This is alarming knowing that anyone can go inside the resort. They only requested our identities when we checked-in at the hotel, but other than that we freely got inside the vicinity of Caliraya. The hotel is atop the place. The area where I lost my phone is nearest attraction in the main entrance of the resort.Though I must say I enjoyed the feeling that I'm close to nature. Trees and green grass are everywhere. There are goats roaming freely. But then again, it could've been better. There are a lot of spaces that would be good if decorated by gardeners or landscapers. The room was very outdated. The aircon works just fine. The beds are okay. The toilets can get easily clogged. We didn't have a problem falling asleep, but then again it's just mediocre. Very basic.Also, don't go here if you dont like walking. SInce the area is huge and uneven, you will have to do a lot of walking and climbing stairs.You have to pay for 100 pesos if you want to have internet access. Not worth it since internet access is only available at the hotel lobby. No internet access in the rooms.Food was basic too. It's actually convenient that for hotel guests our breakfast, lunch and dinner buffet with overflowing coffee and juice were already included. But the food itself was just okay. Even I can cook better."}

The rides are good and there are a good amount of options for those who don't like things like roller coasters. The best ride was probably the Jurassic Park rapids ride, however you do get wet! We didn't mind at all as it was such a hot day that some splashes were nice, however sitting around in wet shoes all day is not nice. Make sure that you take shoes that it doesn't matter if they get wet as they will easily dry! We purchased the front of line pass - and although we didn't go on a number of rides (all the roller coasters) it was still worth the purchase. Some of the rides had wait times of 45-75 minutes, yet with the front of line pass you go right to the front and get through immediately. It is very hot at Universal Studios so try to choose a cooler day to go."}

All animals, in their natural environment, actively doing things (eating, roaring, moving about etc). As this is a night safari, it is dark and taking good photos is impossible (you cannot use your flash). What this does though, is gives you a chance to really see the animals. It's amazing as they are all out active, not sleeping like you get in the normal zoos. The Creatures of the Night show is fantastic and I definitely recommend it. There are only a few of these shows a night (weather dependent) so make sure you get in early so you don't miss out. The train is a great way to see the majority of the animals, but don't forget to get off and do the walking trails, as you can rejoin the train at any time."}

You will be pleasantly surprised and as both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are kept air-conditioned, this makes a great place to visit on a hot day. We thought we'd only be there for a short time but we spent half a day there, and could have spent longer, only we left it too late to go. The Cloud Forest include a walk on a suspended bridge and a large waterfall - both of which are fantastic. The Flower Dome will have you taking more photos of flowers than you have ever taken before! It is very tranquil and relaxing."}

Our first night was quite uncomfortable as the bed was very hard, however in the morning we found they had a full pillow menu available including being able to request a mattress topper. We requested this when we went out and when we came back it was to find an amazingly comfortable bed and pillows!I'm not sure if any of the rooms get a view of Clarke Quay - in the photos of the hotel it looks like they all look over the pool and Clarke Quay, however on the floors on the sides of the hotel, these windows are all along the corridor and the rooms are on the other side of the corridor. We overlooked a street and it was still a pleasant enough view out the window, however we really weren't in the room to enjoy it much!The room was very spacious and the air-conditioning works well, being fully adjustable making it pleasant to come home to after a long day of sightseeing. We would leave a key in the power so that the room would be nice and cool when we got back. The room has blackout drapes, a usable fridge with a minibar, an in-room safe and bathrobes and slippers. The best part is that the room also comes with a Handy phone – this is basically a mobile phone for you to use during your stay. This includes free international calls (as many as you want), internet services outside the hotel and access to big savings on all the attractions around Singapore. We saved heaps by buying our tickets using this phone. You would then be either emailed your e-tickets to show at the attraction or you would be emailed something to print. Printing is available by seeing the Concierge. Some examples of savings are the Gardens by the Bay down from $28 to $18 per person, the aquarium on Sentosa down from $34 to $20.90 per person – so well worth doing, especially if you have a big family!You also get 2 complimentary bottles of water every day which is a nice touch. The swimming pool is excellent. There is a large pool with a water slide as well as a smaller kids pool with its own water slide and an outdoor Jacuzzi. We found the best time to swim (with minimal people) was last thing at night between 9pm and 10pm. It’s lovely to cool down after a long day.The only negatives are that the bath is over the shower and it is quite high to get in and out of. The fact that the shower sliding door doesn’t open right up also makes it more difficult. I had trouble and I’m in my 30’s. If you are elderly or have an injury, ask for a room without the bath.Also, the breakfast is on the expensive side as far as hotels go. The buffet breakfast will cost you $36 plus 10% service charge and 7% GST, making it over $42. We had the a la carte breakfast in the same restaurant and while the cost wasn’t too bad - $18 for eggs benedict (plus 17%) and $16 for Croque Monsieur (plus 17%) we were a bit shocked when we saw the bill was for $61. We had ordered 2 orange juices and these came to $10.53 (including the 17%) each! That is the most expensive glass of orange juice I’ve ever had. After this day, we found a wonderful little place across the road in the Clarke Quay Central called Kraftwich – you can get a freshly squeezed orange juice (much nicer than the hotel one) for a fraction of the cost!Two drinks at the hotel bar will also set you back over $30.00. We ordered a glass of wine and a beer and this came to $34.00 – however saying this – this is a pretty standard cost for alcohol across Singapore.The location of the hotel is amazing – right in the heart of Clarke Quay. There are restaurants and cafes everywhere to choose from for breakfast (although most don’t seem to open before about 11am), lunch and dinner. For dinner, you need to get in early, as the locals eat later and the place fills up quickly. We never had an issue with the noise from Clarke Quay, or from any other guests at all. The room was quiet and it was great being able to see a part of the Quay and hear the music from the pool at night.The Clarke Quay MRT (train station) is directly across the road in Clarke Quay Central, or there is another entry to the station behind the hotel. This one is great if it is raining as you walk along the side of the hotel undercover the whole way. Travelling on the MRT is easy and efficient – they come every 2-4 minutes. Overall, we would rate this hotel as a 9 out of 10 as it was very comfortable, quiet and you couldn’t beat the location. We would definitely stay again the next time we come to Singapore.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Ask for one without a bath if you elderly or with injury as the baths are very high and it is hard t...\nSee more room tips"}

There is nothing better on a sunny day that being on or around the harbour. Whether it is catching a ferry to Manly, or even just around to Darling Harbour it is a treat for young and old alike. The harbour during times like Vivid and New Years Eve just comes alive and you can while away many hours watching the ships come in and out. The cruise ships are always a treat to see arriving or departing."}

I was sharing a 2 bedroom apartment with my mother. We had already decided beforehand to book this hotel and she would have the single bed room as I am much taller and am well past single beds. When we arrived it was to find that the one bathroom in the place was a very tiny ensuite off the double room. As she needs to get up and go to the toilet multiple times during the night there was no way around it. I got the single. Sharing the small ensuite was annoying and you couldn't swing a cat in either the toilet or the shower. I definitely wouldn't want to share with someone I didn't know well as midnight trips to the bathroom/toilet have to be made through the other person's bedroom!The single bedroom was no bigger than my closet at home and both beds were hard and uncomfortable. The single bed when sat on was broken and it made for 5 nights of misery and no sleep. We did try and swap to another room but were told all rooms were the same, all we could do was get 2 single rooms at another $1000 each. As we had already spent $1225 for 5 nights there was no way we would have paid that! All in all a very disappointing stay. The lounge room was ok with a comfortable couch and a big flatscreen TV. The hotel was right on the South Perth foreshore, not that we would have known as there was no view. Most of the windows were frosted glass and you couldn't see out at all. Location is good next to the Mends St ferry which goes to the city but the place needs to be renovated badly."}

There are some good passes going in combination with the Hop On Hop Off bus though so it is definitely worth doing if you haven't been to one before. We were a bit disappointed that we got ushered into a show and then when it was over we were at the exit and couldn't go back, despite not seeing the last floor."}

As Vivid was on in Sydney we chose this hotel as we wanted an unobstructed view of the Harbour Bridge and Opera House. We booked a Deluxe Full Harbour View Room and were given room 1714.Well we weren't disappointed! The view was amazing with a very clear view of the bridge, opera house and Circular Quay. We also had the best view of the cruise ships that were docked at the port and really enjoyed watching 3 different cruise ships come and go in that time. The room was quite spacious for one of the smaller rooms on offer and featured a king bed, a fridge which contained the mini bar but also had enough space to use (an essential for us), a separate shower and bath in the bathroom, a table and 2 chairs - which we placed in front of the window to watch the world go by. Free wifi was good, fast and reliable.The hotel itself was lovely with staff very friendly and helpful. We were delighted to come back to the room on our first night and find a bottle of sparkling wine in an ice bucket. This went down a treat while we enjoyed the view. I can tell you that the bottle was not a cheap one either ($180!). This was a lovely anniversary surprise. Housekeeping come around several times a day and on the last time they offer to turn down the bed. Complimentary bottles of water are refreshed daily - which is a really nice touch. The hotel is located right at the end of Circular Quay and is very close to all the ferries (going to Manly, Darling Harbour etc) and the train station. You can catch the airport train to and from the airport straight to Circular Quay station and then it is a couple of minutes walk to the hotel. Perfect! It is approx 10 - 15 minutes walk to the CBD, Pitt St Mall etc.My only issue with the room was the toilet. Due to the placement of the toilet next to the shower, there is very little space. Unfortunately the toilet paper holders have been put in the worst position (exactly at leg level) so you really have to take the toilet paper off the holder to sit comfortably. The toilet is also very hard to flush - you have to hold the button down hard for approx 30 seconds for it to flush.These were very minor things though and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. This is the best hotel to stay in if you are wanting a view of the harbour. These rooms would be absolutely fantastic during Vivid and New Years Eve (or anytime of the year really)! We will definitely be back.\n\n\nRoom Tip: Book one with a full view!\nSee more room tips"}

The VIP passes are worth doing as you don't have to line up at all for rides/attractions. The price of food is astronomical though! I couldn't get over the price for ice-cream! The animal actors show was very good and interactive. Just beware on the large escalators. We had a tourist in front of us who was taking photos and she stepped back to take the photo and of course fell down the step and backwards into my husband. My husband and her would have gone flying if I hadn't grabbed onto his arm. I had to haul him back up and then he helped her up. Very dangerous!"}

We flew back into LA about 10pm and caught the Hilton free shuttle. The driver was very friendly and customer orientated. Unfortunately the service at the hotel was not as receptive upon arrival. At the time we were there the Amma tour was there with thousands of people, consequently the check in desk was extremely busy and we ended up waiting to check in to our room for at least 40 minutes. Not the best when you are tired, hungry and just want to get to your room. Likewise the whole place over the two days was swarming with people and the lifts were always full etc. The hotel room was as per a normal Hilton - nice comfortable bed, spacious room. The bathroom was a little old and in need to repairs. Overall due to the closeness of the airport and the benefit of the airport shuttle - this is a good option for layovers. The LA Hop on Hop Off bus also leaves from just outside the hotel and goes all over LA. We caught the bus down to Santa Monica Pier and then to a shopping centre and got a taxi back to the hotel. The taxi cost was very reasonable so it seems to be a good base to do other things. There are also a number of restaurants etc in the area."}

Our room wasn't ready so they upgraded us to a Suite on the top floor! This was the nicest room we had in our whole trip through America and Canada. The suite was amazing! A huge bedroom with the most comfortable king size bed and a large TV which made you just want to stay in bed and watch tv despite being on holiday! The spacious bathroom had heated flooring, a heated toilet seat and LED lighting in the toilet - first time I had ever seen this but it made for an amusing trip to the toilet in the night. There was a very large lounge, with sofa, TV, desk, coffee table and a combined kitchen/dining room. The room also had a large balcony with table and chairs. Really this was everything you could ask for and hope for on an extended stay somewhere and we really wish we had been staying for more than 2 nights!The hotel does a complimentary breakfast down in the dining room in the morning which caters a cold and hot breakfast - this was very good particularly because it was included. Parking at the hotel was easy to use and no issues.The area is very good as there are a lot of restaurants, cafes, supermarkets within a couple of blocks. It is also a short walk (about 10 minutes) to the tram stop which takes you right into the city and to the Calgary Tower.The service was excellent and they were always trying to help - offering umbrellas when it was raining etc. It was a fantastic stay and we would definitely stay again if going back to Calgary.\n\n\nRoom Tip: See if you can get a suite when you book or whether they will upgrade you - well worth it!\nSee more room tips"}

This was because the ground floor was very noisy from the person upstairs. Each time they moved the floor would creak and wake us.Will on reception was great at changing our room and offered to help us move due to the stairs to the second floor.The room was nice and had a balcony with view of the mountains. There is a TV, coffee maker, fridge and free wifi, though it did have issues at being slow a lot.The bed was comfy and we had room service for breakfast a few times which was great and they don't have a service charge per order which was good.The hotel is on the outskirts of Banff but with a car, it was perfect location. The drive was a few minutes to town and the opposite direction took you up a nice scenic mountain drive with a great lookout.The parking was free and appeared to be plenty of spots.We really enjoyed our time here and the staff were all fantastic!"}

It occupies the top 3 floors of another building.Checkin was easy and each time were given the access code for free wifi. If entering From Hornby street, you need to go up the escalators to reception. The room is large with a double bed, tv, fridge, microwave, toaster and kettle. The windows go from floor to ceiling and give a great view. The bathroom is a nice size snd water pressure is good.One thing about the bed is that one our first stay, the sides of the mattress were very soft and we almost rolled out of the bed. We placed a pillow underneath on each side and this helps. Stay 2 was much better so rectification was not needed. There are some cafes and shops not far away as well and the hop on hop off bus stops across the road.All in all, its a decent hotel that offers everything you might need."}

We checked in late about 9.30pm and went to our room. We had booked a loft suite and on seeing it, was dissapointed that the stairs would be too much for my wife after a recent injury. We went to the hotel restaurant before they closed and after asked reception if another room on a single level was available. Luckily for us it was so we ended up in room 247. It was a reasonable room which had the main bedroom in a separate room to the living and kitchen. The bathroom was tiny, just enough room to get the door closed before using the loo.There is also an upstairs with 3 single beds but we didn't use this area.The bedroom was small with a queen bed and 2 bedside tables and lamps. The bed was comfortable.The shower was in the bath but lacked pressure.There is free wifi which worked well on the first night, but not so well in day 2 but most likely due to weather conditions that day. The rest of our stay it was perfect.As others have mentioned the lack of aircon I won't go into that again, but yes it got hot while we were here, the fan in the room does help however.Overall it is a nice hotel that caters for what you'll need while in Jasper, just don't expect a 5 star City hotel like a Hilton. It is a short walk to the town centre but a car is needed to see the amazing sights this town has to offer!The staff were great and the restaurant food and service was fantastic!\n\n\nRoom Tip: Bring insect repellent for while you're in the national parks of Canada\nSee more room tips"}

It was amazing!Michael was our guide and boy he really knows his stuff. The tour had 5 people plus Michael in the 4wd. It could hold another 2 comfortably or 3 at a stretch. Leg room was good in the back too.Our first point of call was whistler mountain where he said we might see some bears. We saw the alpha male Slumber first. He was huge and about 100m away. In the same spot we saw a mother and 2 yearlings about 50m away. They scampered away after spotting Slumber who then came much closer, and even crossed the road not far in front of us.Higher up we spotted another mother with 2 yearlings playing about on a patch of unmelted snow. Shortly after they came to within about 25m of us. It was fantastic to witness them in the wild.We headed over to blackcomb mountain next and saw another mother with 2 young Cubs. These came close by and crossed the road near us before the Cubs climbed up a tree.We saw a total of 14 bears on our tour which was plenty and every time we got out of the car to take photos. We had plenty of time as well and the tour lasted about 3 hours.Along with the Bears there is also very beautiful scenery to see along the way. We even went directly beneath the peak to peak gondola on our travels.This is a must do tour on your trip to whistler and you won't regret it!"}

She gave us a card to allow access to the parking garage and would call when our room was ready.On checking in later we were given a free upgrade to a king suite on the third floor overlooking the pool. It was fantastic and we also had a plate with a large brownie slice with chocolate sauce and berries waiting for us on the table as well as a Polaroid camera for our special occasion.There is plenty of space in this room which has heating, cooling, free wifi, TV, iPad on bedside, a mini fridge, sofa, table and 4 chairs, cheapest snacks for a hotel ever, and basic kitchen facilities. We went to the marketplace IGA and bought some things to have breakfast in the room so saved heaps that way. The bed was really comfy and we slept well every night.Location wise, the hotel is in a great spot and nice and quiet. It's only minutes away from the pedestrian area of whistler. The bathroom is slightly small and the water pressure could have been better.Overall we were very happy here and would choose again in our return.While in Whistler, do yourself a favour and book a tour with Michael at Bear viewing ecotours.

The room was large and spatious, had a comfortable king bed and was very clean. Our view out the window was of the monorail and Hooters. Not exactly the Strip view that we thought we had booked. Realistically the view doesn't matter as Vegas is a 24/7 town, you will not see much of your hotel room. We didn't return until around midnight every night and by then you want to get to bed, not be looking out the window. We took a taxi to the hotel from the airport which cost about $22. The location of the hotel is right at the southern end of the strip and was perfect for us. There are so many restaurant and food options both in the hotel and on the strip. We aalso saw David Copperfield who has a show at the MGM, this was really entertaining and good. For first time visitors to Vegas who ard interestec in doing and seeing a bit more than the casino, partying or drinking, make sure you have comfy shoes. We walked a lot of the strip on our last day and it was 18km walking! The hotel really has everything you need and was one of the best that we went into. The only downside was the noise. The rooms are not soundproof at all and our room was facing the airport. Therefore from about 7am to 9-10pm you have not only lots of planes but also the helicopters buzzing constantly overhead. The worst thing though was our last night. We had a morning flight out of Vegas and headed to bed about 12.30am, unfortunately this was the time that the room oppositeand next to us checked in. From then until 3.30am there was loud talking, constant door slamming and running up and down the corridor. At 3.30am we had finally had enough and rang reception. Security was straight on it came up and told them to go to bed (we think). They quietened down but the about 20 mins later we had another person with a stereo walking down the hotel hallway with a sterro blaring music (by now it was 4am). We then had a couple coming back for the night and having a deep and meaningful in the hall. I went down to reception to complain and passed multiple young females passed out at the end of the hall near the lifts. It didnt seem like the hotel had cameras or were keeping an eye on these sorts of things. Maybe ask for a quiet room (if they have one) if you plan on sleeping."}

We were offered to upgrade to a higher floor for $20 a night, but declined. We were then given a room on the 10th floor instead of the 4th floor for free. Bonus!The room we had was very spacious and has a king bed which was oh so comfy, maybe the comfiest hotel bed we've ever used!Our view is of the Hollywood highland centre and partially of the pool.Everything else about the room was as you'd expect. Shower pressure was fine but not fantastic. It us very spacious and water doesn't get all over the floor. It was also quite clean and the mirror doesn't fog up like everywhere else.The location was great for Hollywood's main sights. We didn't have a car but was able to get the metro right near the hotel to the stop for universal studios very easily.The hotel is right in the centre of a very touristy area. Due to this, there are a large number of people out the front. Where there are lots of tourists, there are also lots of hawkers trying to get money out of you. Just tell them no and they will try the next person. They aren't overly pushy or agressive but just annoying. In the actual highland centre, it is very clean and nice, good restaurants and things to do without the crowds. We had breakfast in the hotel's restaurant one morning and it was sufficient but for $27 plus tax plus tip, a bit overpriced for what you got. Also they are sneaky when a waiter comes around to your table before ordering and asks if you want juice or coffee or both, we got 2 juices and a coffee, then look at the menu and see thats $18 in just drinks! She did mention that if you choose the buffet then all drinks are included. Maybe this is just a standard American trait?We got a really good price when we booked many months in advance but noticed that a few weeks before our stay, the price was in the thousands. So book early."}

It is set on a hill so you get a wonderful view of Dunedin surrounds from the balcony.Probably the best thing is how clean the rooms are. Spotless! There is also everything you could need. A full kitchen, a washer and dryer, a stereo system, robes, a great spa in the bathroom for 2 people, full toiletries (including make up remover wipes - I've never seen this before!), plenty of towels to use. Free paper delivered in morning.The lift when you get in is spotlessly clean. You get 200mb free Internet to use. Minibar items are fairly well priced. The manager Neville was lovely and very helpful and friendly.All in all a fabulous hotel, only issue we had was that the bed was too soft and we like a hard bed. We both had sore backs when we woke up. This is just our preference though.This hotel definitely earns its number 1 spot on trip advisor for Dunedin hotels! Can't wait to stay again on the trip back."}

The room had standard Novotel furnishings. The toilet is separate and near the door but the bathroom entrance is next to the bed – very close and awkward, especially if someone is using it during the night with the light on as the door is glass.Room temperature was hot – and you weren’t able to turn it down. We had to turn it off and open the windows as it was freezing outside.Room service is available until midnight. The restaurant is more of a cafe (it is even named Novotel Cafe) and offers a large menu on the front door of the hotel, yet when we went in there, we were given a small paper menu with about 6 main meal choices all in German. We waited for about 15 minutes for the waiter to come back so we could ask for an English menu, however no one came back so I had to go and find the waiter and ask. They did not have English menus available but he said he would translate the menu. When he did this, he missed half the items. After placing our order, we noticed that 3 or 4 other tables that had arrived after us (all German speaking) were already on their first courses. They also all had bread. We got bread about 10 minutes later. We then had a good 30-40 minute wait for our meal. In the meantime all the other tables had received several lots of bread, yet we only received the one. When we eventually got the meal (after the other tables who had arrived after us had already eaten 3 courses and left), it was absolutely lovely – the food was delicious.The breakfast was great, it was a full buffet.The location is pretty good, 10 minutes by tram number 9, direct to the door of the hotel. WI-FI is available in the lobby only, you need to ask at reception for a code which is good for 24 hours.Overall the hotel wasn’t bad, the thing that really let it down was the waiter in the restaurant on the night we went. It was the worst service we’ve ever had."}

There were no toiletries available in room, except for 1 bar of soap.There was no information in room on area, attractions, and internet. Only the room service menu.There is an onsite restaurant with pub food. They have regular events at weekends (shows), which there was one on whilst we were staying and the place was packed with people.Room service was great – fantastic gourmet looking food and tasted great – see photos.We asked reception for a map of Liverpool and they didn’t have any. The receptionist did try and print one out from the internet for us though.The hotel is about 15 minutes away from the Liverpool Docks area.

Inside the room not so nice (room 410). Room is a decent size. Ceiling is about 4m high, which makes the full length curtains look a bit “churchy”.One wall has marks all over it from shoes and other suitcases. The bed is a little lumpy but a nice size. There is a large desk with a mini bar fridge. TV has sky (paid TV). Nice amount of wardrobe space. In-room safe. Bathroom tidy but fittings are not installed properly. Hand soap rails are loose, sink is not level. Shower pressure ok but not good.Hotel staff are stupid. We pre-paid €15 a day for parking and were told to park on the side of the hotel (behind gates) but still easily seen or accessible from the train station or road. Noticed there was undercover parking (boom gate) to the left of the hotel, asked about this and was told we park in the open space still. Went back later to see a different receptionist and he said that the area was fine but when we said we had pre-paid for undercover parking, he checked the system and saw we had. He told us how to get access to the undercover parking which we did. Not much parking down there as there was a lot of chairs and other hotel items being stored there. It was very difficult to manoeuvre into a position which is probably why they don’t like people parking down there.We were informed about the free shuttle bus from hotel to Vatican City/City Centre. It only runs every 1.5 hours and only has one return service. Also the bus holds only 5 or 7 people at a time. The first time we tried booking we were told it was full. So we booked it for the next day and we were told they were the last seats available. The next day, no one else turned up so it was only us in the bus. No doubt other people had been turned away. It was a very scary trip to the city and we feared for our lives (with good reason as the van was more than a little beat up). Best thing to do is to catch bus 990 to Piazza Cavour from just down the road. Purchase a ticket from a ticket machine near the bus stop or tobacconists everywhere before boarding as you can’t buy a ticket from the driver. €1 for 75mins anywhere in Rome.Breakfast is reasonable – no hot food, only cold meat or cheese plus the usual cereal, bread etc.The restaurant for dinner was ok also. Service for the hotel was generally poor. In our room there was no information booklet for the hotel services on offer. When we told the receptionist about this he looked at us like we were crazy – kept saying ‘in your room’, but it wasn’t. We ended up giving up.Internet was available in the lobby for €1.90 for half an hour.Rooms not very soundproof – we had Italians next door who kept slamming doors and arguing until well after midnight each night.Neighbourhood doesn’t seem too bad but still looks dirty as does anywhere in Rome. 20 or 30 minute easy walk to the Vatican City. We left some items there and rang to see if they were found. ‘No, nothing found’. Another words the cleaners decided to keep them for themselves. We wouldn’t stay at this hotel again. Overall satisfaction 4 out of 10."}

There was a balcony which you could go out on with a table and chairs to sit and take in the view.  There was a modern and renovated bathroom which was also very spacious. There was no shower curtain , just a small glass divide which equals a wet floor.Well equipped kitchen with microwave, bar fridge, dishwasher and stove top. There was a flat screen TV and the bed was very comfortable!Parking was $10 a day and was undercover. Laundry facilities available for a cost ($5 for washing machine, $2 for dryer).Bus 112 takes you to Monaco in about 10-15 mins. The Eze bus stop is very close to the hotel, but the return bus is not well signposted at all.

His response was unexpectedly immediate, and he made sure that my stay was as comfortable as it can be. As a guest, I felt the hospitality and quality of service that Nobu had to offer as a five-star hotel. During my stay, Marlon even contacted me thru the in-room phone to make sure that I was having a wonderful time at Nobu. A hotel staff brought a tea set to my room as a welcome gift, and they also promptly accomplished my requests (e.g. more pillow, replenish toiletries, etc). I especially loved the complimentary bowl of fruits that welcomed me as I entered my room. These small but meaningful gestures truly make Nobu stand out from other hotels, even when compared to fellow five-star hotels. I look forward to staying at Nobu again later this year for my birthday staycation."}

There were mourners dressed in all-black who came to pay their respects to the king. The crowds were huge, but the tour of the palace was still enjoyable. The intense heat, though, became difficult to overcome. Regardless, my first visit to the Grand Palace was indeed a memorable one."}

And the morning before we went to SM Mall of Asia, my mom once again called the restaurant and confirmed our reservation. She told one of the staff that we'll be arriving between 11:30 and 12:00 in the afternoon. To our surprise, we were put in the waiting list instead of the reservation list. One staff even told us that we missed our turn which was scheduled for 11 am so we need to be put last in the list. Apparently, we were supposed to receive a text confirmation of our reservation but we did not. That's why we were included in the waiting list. Clearly, a big misunderstanding was made between my mom and the staff whom she talked with. Fortunately, we were able to sort things out with the manager of the restaurant who was present when we were questioning their reservation method. The manager realized that the fault was on their part so he humbly let us in. The ambiance in the restaurant is great. The decorations, fixtures, and furnitures looked like they were part of the hotel. All the food were merged in a long and spacious hall to make it easier for guests to get whatever they want. With regards to the taste and genres of food offered, Buffet 101 has made excellent efforts to provide good quality cuisines from different nations. They have Japanese, Filipino, Italian, Chinese, American, and other food genres that I may have failed to notice. The taste of the food is much better compared to other buffet restaurants. Despite the good food and ambiance, I think the restaurant should improve in their reservation strategy so that no other guest will have to go through what we experienced. To end my review, let me share a few tips and must-trys that you may find useful in your visit to Buffet 101:1. Know what's \"heavy\" and what's not. The goal of eating in a buffet is to taste as much as what is available for you to eat. Do not waste your stomach space in food that you know will make you easily full (e.g. rice, more than 1 serving of noodles).2. Don't eat what you can always have. If you always eat Pork Adobo (a famous Filipino dish), then why still eat it at the buffet? Sure, a very little serving (just to taste its difference from the other Adobos you have tasted) is fine. But if you will get a large portion of what you can always eat outside the buffet, then you might as well not have bothered splurging for your buffet experience. When eating in a buffet, try eating food that you don't usually encounter. There's no need to fear that you might not be able to finish it if you dislike it since buffet servings are very small. And who knows? You might even discover some new food favorites!3. If it's your birthday, then your meal is free! If you pay cash, you get a 5% discount! And don't worry for possible hidden charges or value added tax, because there's none of that in Buffet 101.4. Know the reservation procedure. When you reserve a seat in the restaurant, be aware that you MUST receive a text confirmation before your scheduled slot at the restaurant. If you don't then don't hesitate to contact them to follow up on your text confirmation.MUST TRYs a. Seafood chowder-very,very tasty. Prepare your stomach though. It comes in a big serving.b. Ebi (Shrimp) Tempura- Tastes good! Not too oily. c. US Angus beef slab something- WOW. The meat is so tender. And the gravy really complements the beef. This is so good!d. Sweet cashews with Sesame seeds- Simple, sweet taste but addicting flavor. Plus, it's nowhere near a heavy snack so you can eat whatever amount you want.e. Beef with eggplant- Unexpectedly good. If you look at it, you might not want to taste it, but when you do, you'll realize that it's really delicious.f. Grilled squids- Oh man. These were great. They were flavorful and yummy!g. Strawberry cheesecake- perfect taste of sweet and tangy!That's it.Enjooy!"}

Probably the most beautiful Calle I have ever seen in my life so far, Calle Crisologo boasts of its beautifully architectured pathway and century-old houses that were now transformed into souvenir shops. Instead of cars, horse-drawn carriages (locally called \"Kalesa\") are the primary transportation in this street. At night, Calle Crisologo transforms into a very romantic scenery. It gives visitors a feel of the Philippines set in the 1800s. Plus, it's a long street, so you really get to enjoy every bit of it. If you're planning to visit Calle Crisologo, here are some tips that you may find useful:1. Visit the place at night or at dusk. With the yellow lights brightening up the streets, the Calle becomes even more beautiful and romantic. Plus, it's not that hot anymore so you get to enjoy walking along the long street.2. Ride a Kalesa. If you plan on going more than a single time at Calle Crisologo, then try riding a Kalesa (horse-drawn vehicle) even once. You will get to really feel the 19th century aura of the place. Don't forget to document your ride!3. Lots of souvenir shops can be found in the street. All souvenir shops sell almost the same items so don't rush into buying from the first shop you see. Try to visit many shops and compare prices. I think you cannot bargain for lower prices but all the salespeople in the shops are absolutely friendly and helpful. They wouldn't even nag you to buy anything from them. If you don't want to buy anything from a shop, they'll just let you leave without urging you to look at their other products.4. If you have a keen eye, you might even find the museum. The Syquia Museum, home to former Philippine President Elpidio Quirino and wife Dona Alicia Syquia, is not exactly found along Calle Crisologo, but the Calle marks the best way to reach the museum. Only one turn from Calle Crisologo, the Syquia Museum was originally the biggest and richest house in Vigan. Now, as a museum, it features century old ceramics, art, furniture, glassware, and even ceramics that originated from the Ming Dynasty. 5. Immortalize your moments. I think there's no need to remind any tourist to take pictures or videos. But in this case, it is very much encouraged that you document your walk along the street because it's something that you will always want to remember. Believe me, the ambiance in this street is so peaceful and relaxing that you will surely want to reminisce it when you're finally back to your hometown. That's it! Try to experience this yourself. Its really worth the time and effort."}

Sumaguing Cave is a very vast cave found in Sagada, Mountain Province. I think it serves as one of the main tourist attractions of the place. Stepping into Sumaguing cave is a real adventure. We spent more than 3 hours going around the cave. The first phase of the caving experience includes a very steep and narrow path towards the inner part of the cave. This part is surrounded by bat feces in the rocks (and in some situations you have no choice but to hold on to them). The second phase of the cave involves water. Super cold water. You may need to remove your footwear during this part since the pathway will be very slippery. The third phase of the cave is probably the most challenging. We went through very small entry points to reach the next part of the cave. We also \"rappelled\" inside the cave, in which we landed in the coldest waist-length water I have ever dipped in. We also climbed a stout but challenging mountain of smooth rocks to finally make our way out. It that's not enough, the exit path of the cave is also the entrance, so you will encounter the steep rocks and the bat feces once again. Overall, the experience was very challenging, yet absolutely fun and amazing. This attraction is not for the faint-hearted or the claustrophobic; however, it serves as a good way to see nature in a different way.A word of advice: If you are not experienced with caving, it is not advisable for you to go alone. You must have experienced people (or natives) with you when you enter as Sumaguing cave is not a typical, easy-way-out cave to explore."}

Everytime I go back, I see the same attractions over and over again. Fortunately, from my last visit, I saw new rides and attractions. To make my review simpler, I'll just enumerate the positive and negative points of the Park.POSITIVE:1. The entrance fee is relatively cheap compared to other theme parks around the world (About $13).2. The mixture of attractions is fit for adults and children alike. NEGATIVE:1. It' so far from the city. Although there are various ways of reaching the theme park, the travel alone is tiring and very time consuming.2. It's very very small compared to other theme parks around the world.3. It has other attractions which require additional payment. These attractions are not included in the Park Day Pass.4. There are only few rides and attractions to see. In a non-crowded day, you can finish all the attractions in less than half a day. 5. It's a little expensive. The souvenir shops have way too few souvenirs.And a few tips if you plan on going to the park:1. Be there before the park opens. If you go there a few hours after opening time, the waiting lines will surely be crowded already.2. Take note of promos, opening times, etc. (You can refer to EK's official site for more details-- www.enchantedkingdom.ph)3. Bring extra clothes and wear comfy clothes.4. Bring a bag that's easy to carry. However, if you get really irritated of carrying your bag throughout your stay at the park, you can always rent lockers. The locker area is found on the right sight of the entrance (near the bumper cars), and each locker costs about $2.5. Be attentive. Take care of your personal belongings. 6. The Rio Grande Rapids is a must-ride. There you have it!"}

It has many stores for different types of people. The Midtown Wing is home to internationally recognized brands. The Padre Faura Wing has local shops that offer good quality products/services. You can find many specialty restaurants within the mall-- ranging from American, Italian, Persian, Japanese to even Mexican. Usually, many people visit the mall since:1. Its location is very near two schools (University of the Philippines-Manila and St. Paul's College Manila), 2. Around it are lots of hotels where tourists stay.3. It is located in the Pedro Gil area~ a very busy sector of Manila.Visiting the mall for the first time might be tricky. You're lucky if your hotel is near the mall. However, if it's far, don't plan on visiting, especially if you're going to commute. The mall can't be easily seen from the main roads of Manila. You might have to get a cab (which is not recommendable because some cab drivers will just take advantage of you) in order to reach it. In case you plan to visit the mall, here's a guide on what to see per level (around the whole mall): Ground Floor: Department store, lots of Restaurants and Fast food chains, international and local brands/boutiques for men and women, GrocerySecond Floor: Department store, international and local brands/boutiques for men and women, restaurants, Bowling alleyThird Floor: Arcade, Department store, international and local brands/boutiques for kids, Gadgets, Food court, gymFourth Floor: Services [salons, barber shop, etc], bingo station, movie house"}

If the seller doesn't give it to you for the price you like, just move along. There'll still be plenty of stores that sell the same stuff.

However, its size didn't stop it from being the happiest place on earth. I visited during the weekend, and I must say that there's a lot of people who went to the park as well. Good thing the rides had waiting times to let you know how long you're going to wait for a specific ride. Overall, the experience was great. I think the staff inside the park were very friendly and professional. It was a good value for money.Now, here are some tips that may be useful for you when you plan to visit HK Disneyland: 1. Everything sold inside the park is pricey (even the food and drinks!), so make sure to bring lots of money especially if you're planning to buy many souvenirs from there. 2. Take advantage of the 10% discount for all items in the Emporium, Mainstreet Sweets, and other shops when you purchase products before 11:30 am. 3. Don't miss the parades (yes, there are more than just one~ Flights of Fantasy Parade at 1 pm and Mickey's Waterworks Parade at 4 pm) and the shows (Philharmagic, Golden Mickeys, Festival of the Lion King) because they are really great and entertaining. 4. Upon entering the park, do get a guide map and times guide to help you out around the attractions inside the park. 5. If you have company, you can still take advantage of the single rider's lane, especially in Space Mountain. If you and your company don't mind sitting beside another guest at the roller coaster, you can enter as single riders (there's a separate line for that) and save yourself the burden of waiting around 45 minutes for the ride in the regular line. The single rider lane generally doesn't fill up-- even a single bit!6. If you plan to watch Mickey's Waterworks Parade up front, an umbrella or raincoat will be helpful, because you will definitely be wet afterwards.7. Try to stay until the closing time. As you may know, the park closes with a display of fireworks. Believe me, just imagining it is very very different from actually seeing it."}

These Superior Rooms are located in the lower floors and are different from the Regal Club rooms which are located on the upper floors and are a little bit more expensive. To my great surprise and happiness, the concierge upgraded us to Regal Club rooms for free! The rooms were beautiful. They were spacious and modernly designed. The bathroom was great as well, with complete amenities-- a bunch of different sized towels, bathrobe, shampoo, lotion, toothbrush kit, hairdryer, and everything else you can find in a well-appointed bathroom. You have to pay for the mouthwash, though. Although the hotel was nice, there still are other matters that it needs to attend to. First is the compulsory \"down payment\" of sort that you need to pay before you could check-in to your room. They need this to guarantee that if you consume any item/service not included in your hotel package, you can still pay for it. You will need to surrender USD 125 per room to the concierge before you check-in. If in case you didn't buy anything aside from your hotel package, you will get the exact money you surrendered when you check-out. But if you do, then they'll just deduct the things/services that you bought and give you back the change. I understand that they have to do this. However, the problem with this transaction is that the guests, in this case, we, were not informed of any \"down payment\". We were quite surprised that we have to surrender 300 bucks. I am sure that the other guests were quite shocked as well. Second, the lobby contained only 2 single seats. I don't really know why they wouldn't put any more seats. It's funny, really. But if your legs just need to relax and the two seats are already taken, just go to the second and third floors near the escalators. There you'll find sofas that would make your tired legs happy. Overall, this hotel was great. I don't know about the other people who said the concierge were disappointing, but during my stay, they were totally not. I guess we were just lucky. Regal Kowloon Hotel is conveniently located in East Tsim Sha Tsui, with many shops and food chains nearby.\n\n\nRoom Tip: The higher the floor, the better.\nSee more room tips"}

Getting budget taxis is difficult. All the taxis that go via Trader's Hotel is premium taxis (i.e. premium price). I got a double bedroom which was quite small. A staff at the restaurant was selective in her hospitality. She was rather curt and generally unhelpful to locals (I am a local) but went out of her way to serve the others. I find this discrimination rather disappointing in this day and age. Guess some people still have the colonial mentality."}

Previously called Holiday Inn. Fist impression wasn't that great as we were left standing a bit with loads of luggage and 2 children at the front entrance with no dropping off space and doorman. To be fair, I think there was some VIP (Johor EXCO) in the building... wonder why they have the need to block up the front entrances with their cars when they have drivers that could park it properly for them elsewhere. (Unless the driver is a VIP too!). Then, my room wasn't ready when I checked in at 2pm. Got my family and I to wait for about an hour with our luggage on a trolley. The check in and check out counters were not labelled. I was caught standing in the wrong queue. I tried looking for a sign but definitely no signs of it. So, commented to the receptionist.Then, to the hotel's saving grace, they upgraded my room from superior to deluxe for free... everything was better... the room was nice and room service was good. I think there was some piano exams going on upstairs and someone was tuning the piano for hours which annoyed me in the room. Couldn't sleep properly.I loved the location as it's next door to Holiday Plaza and nearby food stalls.That's my two cents... it's a good hotel but still has some more room for improvement for a 4 star hotel."}

It's difficult to find a good holiday destination given the constant attention our kids need and the frequent stops we need to take for naps and snacks for the kids.This propelled us to try out Club Med for the first time to experience if this is suitable for us.Truly, the major plus of Club Med is that toddlers are well taken care of in Petit Club. Our boy truly enjoyed his time there with the GOs and kept asking for more. We even made use of the babysitter arrangement to have 1-2 hours of couple time to enjoy our dinner in peace while our boys were asleep.I also had time to try sailing for the 1st time with a GO and this is also a major plus for Club Med if you enjoy sports.Not forgetting the flying trapeze too! It's been 10years since I last touched this. Photo attached. Definitely gave me a shot of adrenalin rush.What could be improved:Dinner buffet is most often the best meal but we feel breakfast can be further improved.We were the first group of guests in the resort as it reopened post 1st phase of renovation. Facilities definitely need to be improved after nearly 2 decades and believe Club Med is working hard on this."}

It was an excellent choice! I have travelled as a backpacker in Europe, stayed in 4 star hotels in South east Asia, stayed in bad and good hotels in major UK cities; but I was truly amazed at the dedication and attitude of the staff at Le Blanc in delivering a top-notch service. I felt totally immersed in relaxation for 2 weeks. I have never totally felt relaxed on any holiday (not even when I visited my folks!) previously.The hotel is minimalistic in design, clean and fresh. It is well maintained. The dining experience is of a high standard. There are only few times when I thought the service was a tad slow but that is due the large size of our party.Our room faces the ocean and every room has jacuzzi. Our butler were Eduardo and Javier and they are truly helpful despite some hiccups in English-Spanish translation.I did not use the spa as i felt the services there are very overpriced. i had plenty of spa services in the UK and SE Asia and I cannot justify the prices at Le Blanc. However, I took full advantage of the gym and also the classes (pilates, yoga) offered. The pools were very nice and clean and they are not always full, thanks to the fact that the hotel occupancy is only 260. The beach is also very nice and clean. Water is great. The location of the hotel was excellent as it is only about 500m from the party zone! Not far from Coco Bongo which is an excellent club.The wedding packages were rather expensive but we just contracted essential services to bring costs down. I was overall satisfied apart from few minor things. I paid for make up and hairstyling on wedding day but I still had to pay extra if I wanted hair trial ($42 per style) and make up trial. I think hair trial should be included as when a bride paid for make up and hair for wedding day. I didnt think I got the hairstyle that I wanted despite showing photos but fair play the hairstylist did work very hard.There was a little blip when it comes to music playlist during the wedding and reception (they dropped some songs I listed and added songs I didnt want) but i consider this to be minor irritation. i also got different bouquet flower on wedding day due to the windy weather on my weddding day.The wedding coordinator Diana was very helpful and certainly tries her best to coordinate everything and remaining calm. Photography was excellent and professional, I wished he would have taken more group shots though.There are shows every night, e.g. magic shows, circus show, fire dance, jazz band, pop band...sounds cheesy but they are actually quite entertaining.If you dont like alll that there is always the jacuzzi in the room! I had a mini jacuzzi party with my pals in my room trying to dry up the room's mini bar! It was fun.What can I say..top hotel in top location with top event and top service and top cuisine and mini bar.i would recommend this hotel for any discerning traveller.P/s The service like cleaning the room can be somewhat inconsistent ie late..but this is rare..ensure that reception/butler always aware."}

My brorher in-law and I had booked the 9am snorkel the wreck tour. Our tender arrived nearly 20 minutes late at 9:18 and we were told our tour had been rescheduled due to being late (weather and ship fault not ours) and they didnt want it to make the rest of the tours late for rest of the day. We had to cancel the snorkel all together as we had booked other tours during the day with our wives and kids and were only able to do the 9am session. We ended up settling for the 10am Segway tour instead which was the same price but half the time. We enjoyed it but it was not what we came to the island for. Our families joined us for the 11:45 Marine Park Scenic Cruise and guess what that tour was half an hour late to start. Guess it's ok to run that late but not the snorkel. The guy on the Marine Cruise spent more time talking about coming from Harbord near Manly then about the Island unless he was asked a question. Overall the Island is beautifull but the service is very very poor."}

At some attractions there were so many people with this pass that even they made queue and waiting time for normal people was incredibly long. We absolutely not agree with this mechanism and in our opinion it is not way which park should go. It is only making people mad and angry.Another point is that in Jurassic park you need to pay for locker (longer you use it, more money you pay), and together with many people with express pass you are just paying more for locker because they are skipping the queue (you wait more, pay more).If you would like to eat something, we definitely recommend Mel's bistro - great atmosphere with nice double burger."}

The boat was nice and large, very fast trip out to the 2 reefs. The snorkelling gear provided was excellent as was the choice of reefs. We paid the $50 for the hire of an underwater camera and loved how our photos turned out as well as the professional ones already on the disc. Only a few minor issues: Lunch. I was under the expectation that the lunch provided would also come with drinks, but no if you wanted anything to drink for free at lunch you had to use a water bubbler on the back deck other wise all liquids at lunch you had to pay for. Next up was staff, most of the staff were excellent (especially Elvis) but 2 people really got me uncomfortable, one of them (don't know his name but his accent sounded maybe South African) was very touchy feely around all the young female backpackers on the boat and alot of them looked awkward when he was doing it. The next was one of the guys on the back deck when everyone was in the water, I overheard him when I came onboard for some water making jokes about my wife (a larger person) and other larger than average sized people that were in the water. I would have said something but did not want to embarress my wife or any of the others he was mocking. Apart from that we had a great day out with only those minor blemishes."}

On this particular occasion, we noted there are some serious flaws with staying here. The location and external appearance of Darby Park is great, but it is let down by the design of the rooms and the amenity provided in the rooms.The acoustics of the rooms are poor, to the point that you can hear the bathroom being used in the room next door. The bed is rock hard and the pillows feel like you are sleeping on a bag of cement. Whilst not a major issue, the bathrooms are in need of a thorough tile clean, and it was a little inconvenient to have a shower that is not adjustable.Could be a lot better with a few improvements."}

Very thoughtfully designed theme park with well managed facilities. It was our lucky day that the weather was clear and each and every ride was operational, though we waited long in the ques it took almost 2 hours in few rides. But the rides in the park are exciting, Mummy Ride and Galactic are the best rides. I personally liked the Transformers Ride and the Shrek Show. Lots of food options, but little expensive, you can also carry your meal box. There are few shops just to take some memorable gifts and many attractive places to take superb pictures. A must visit place in Singapore."}

Getting to the park is relatively easy, by taking either the Sentosa Express or cable cars to Sentosa, which are close to MRT network.If visiting as a couple with the other half not too interested in the 'big' rides, this saves you a lot of time, particularly as the 'big' rides (the rollercoasters, basically) allow single riders. This saves a lot of time, particularly as during peak times these rides have waiting times varying for between the 45 and 90 minutes. I would recommend going on the 'big' rides in the first hour or two of opening, as you will be disappointed otherwise. You can buy a pass which allows you express entry onto these rides, but this costs about $60 extra, so can result in an expensive day out.Even a few of the family friendly rides are worth a go, even if you don't have kids with you (Puss in Boots and Sesame Street). We queued over an hour for the Madagascar ride, and to be fair, this is pretty average and wouldn't recommend doing so."}

We booked ahead for a table for two, and were seated in the part of the Tiffin Room away from the main tables, next to the hotel lobby. The staff made us feel welcome, offered us tea and coffee, and promptly brought our cake and sandwich selection. We arrived about 20 minutes early, but the staff had no troubles with us being seated early.Some other reviews on here have referenced the buffet, and how this fits in with the perceived view of the 'high tea'. Personally, I had no issues with this, and being a man who likes his food, took advantage of savoury treats on offer. My only reservation is that I wish I had the appetite to take further trips to the buffet, particularly the samosa and the croque monsieur (or whatever they were called).Going to high tea is a good excuse to 'dress up' for a few hours. If you're issue is with the number of people in attendance at one time, then perhaps a bustling city such as Singapore isn't for you."}

As we wanted to site on the terrace and see a view of the City skyline without any particular interest in the restaurants at the Marine Bay Sands, we thought we would give it a go.We opted to book in for drinks and snacks option, which required a minimum $60 spend. I had reserved a spot for 8pm, but unfortunately through no fault of our own the table wasn't available at this time. Despite confirming our booking verbally over the phone and having a record on their booking system, they could not confirm that we would get a booking once we arrived, which was slightly concerning, however, the Manager apologised and offered to waive the charge for the first drink and the minimum spend. I was quite happy to accept this, and by 8:30 we had taken our reserved table. The service thereafter was great, and I apologised for being a bit impatient.The food and drinks are expensive, but that sums up Singapore in general. As it was our honeymoon, it didn't bother us too much. I tried the tasting paddle, and had a couple of extra drinks from the selection. The snacks we tried were decent and tasty. The porter was a particularly good beer, but more of a 'sipping' beer.With the terrace/balcony view, this does come at the price of other people taking photos against the city backdrop. If you don't like this happening, this place isn't for you. We were happy to oblige, but this wouldn't be for everyone."}

We arrived about 4 hours early for check-in, but the hotel were happy to store our bags until the room for available.We stayed in a Hillside Pool Villa, in the second to last row of villas at the top of the hill. The room was spacious, the bed was king sized and the room overlooked the pool. The bathroom was a decent size and had another external shower. The pool was a decent size also, but due to quite a bit of rain on the first couple of days, was a bit cold to use until about the third day.I note that there are multiple reviews on here critical of the breakfast, however, we could not have been happier with the huge selection of food on offer. It seemed to cater for all tastes, from your continental style (pastries, cereal, toast, fruit) to the more asian style hot dishes. I never thought I'd be eating Gouda at breakfast, but it was quite enjoyable. The breakfast restaurant area is a decent size, so there's no issues with finding a table.If staying in the main hillside area, the buggy will be your best friend during your stay. One thing that isn't overly clear when booking is the size of the hill . Even for people in our late twenties with a reasonable level of fitness, it would have been quite a challenge, rain or shine. The staff are happy to do drop offs and pick up at the rooms. Upon ringing Reception from the room, we always found the buggy pick up to be quick, usually no more than 5 minutes, which only slowed down during the expected breakfast and early evening 'rush hour' periods. The buggy saved us from quite a few potential drenchings, so kudos to the hotel for offering this service!The restaurants and bars on within the hotel are all good, albeit quite expensive (but Koh Samui generally isn't that cheap). We thankfully got caught in the bar by the beach during a big downpour, so made the most of happy hour on one night. As others have mentioned, Nan at the top pool bar was a laugh, and made some decent cocktails.One thing to note with the hotel is that it is quite a way out of Chaweng, and getting a taxi is quite expensive into Chaweng (Usually 250/300 Baht). If ordering a taxi from the hotel, you'll always end up with one that costs 300 Baht for a one way trip, as none of the apparent cheaper alternatives will show up. The freeshuttle buses into Chaweng are good when they're running, but there's a decent chunk of time during the evening when there's no free shuttle. It would have been better if the hotel ran more, or spaced these out better throughout the evening.My one gripe with the Hillside Villa was the lack of sea view from the pool, mainly due to the height of trees in front. Had the tree in front been cut down by a metre or two, we would have had an unobstructed view of the island off the coast, without impeding on the privacy of the villa in front. This is something for the resort to consider to improve the views had by guests.Overall a decent resort. Will consider coming back if we return to Koh Samui."}

After checking in, one of the staff took our bags to the room and showed us how to use the free phone provided. It was quite handy to have this during our stay, as on occasion we did need to phone places to book in for lunch and dinner, with it also providing Google Maps (which came in handy). The phone itself was pretty basic and slow with Google Maps (it lagged quite a bit, and sent us in the wrong direction a couple of times), but was good to have around.We stayed in what would have been one of the standard rooms, with a decent sized double room and ensuite which looked out from the first floor onto the pool area. The window partially looked out onto the roof beneath it, which wasn't all that great, but could have been worse.Probably one of the biggest issues with the room was the ensuite. It appeared that this would have been quite nice a number of years ago, but was in dire need of some TLC. There were a number of cracks in the tiles and the grout was a bit dodgy in some places. Also, for some bizarre reason, the door of the ensuite has semi-open slats, which doesn't exactly give much privacy and make it a bit exposed. The opaque window next to the shower was quite filthy on the other side, with mossy growth and dirt on it.The breakfast itself wasn't bad, but not extensive. I believe it would have cost around SGD $35 if not part of the room deal, which it's a bit on the pricey side for two of you, and you'd probably be better off heading out elsewhere.One thing that baffled me was the lack of pedestrian access to Scotts Road. If coming up from the direction of Orchard MRT you have to walk through the car park to reach the main hotel entrance. Would make sense to have a pedestrian access, rather than having to navigate through the car park.The outdoor swimming pool could use a refurb also. It's very dated, and not particularly attractive. The ladders to enter and exit the pool feel as though they are about to give wayOverall, the hotel is in a great location and isn't too badly priced for Singapore. To make it the 5 star hotel it apparently is supposed be, it needs some work to it."}

We were upgraded from a standard room to a deluxe room. The rooms are big for Chilean standards and the bathroom was huge. The hotel is in an antique building with a very old elevator which gives the hotel old movie flair. We did not use the pool; however when we had a look and it seem to us that it was quite small. Sift drinks and water are in the room free of charge. The staff in this hotel is one of the best that we have ever encountered, always friendly and helpful. They sure know how to go the extra mile. For example one day when we came back to the hotel we asked the receptionist if we could have an iron and he said he would send it up to our room. It took us two minutes to take the elevator and go up to our room and the maid was already waiting in front of our room with the iron board. We were impressed. We only had one mishap/miscommunication with the gentlemen that checked us in on the first day. He informed us that breakfast was included in our room which I thought was odd as nothing was mentioned in my reservation and I had not booked the breakfast. My mistake was I did not ask further and thought this is maybe a perk that comes with the upgrade. When we did our checkout, the same gentleman stated that we had to pay the breakfast as it was not included in our room. When we reminded him that he was the one that told us 2 days ago that breakfast was included, he confessed this was a mistake on his side and we had to pay 10$ per person per day. This is a pity as since I’m not a breakfast person; my breakfast consists in one coffee and one croissant. Nevertheless, if you like breakfast they do offer a small but well equipped buffet and you can order a la minute made eggs or omelettes. All in all we had a fantastic stay at this establishment and I would stay here any time again."}

As neither myself or the other half had an interest in scuba diving, we booked the day trip to the Angthong Marine Park with snorkelling and kayaking.We were picked up from our hotel by a private driver for the short journey to 100 Degree East's headquarters. Upon arrival the tour guide/lead gave us the wifi details, water and details about the day's events prior to the short walk to the boat. Upon arrival at the boat, we were introduced to the rest of the crew. In total we had a total of 5 crew for the 12 guests. The boat itself was clean, modern and well maintained. It did not feel claustrophobic at all and was particularly spacious.The first stop of the trip was for the snorkeling at the islands. Upon disembarking into the water, the crew helped everyone out and guided everyone. Unfortunately the recent weather had meant the water was very murky and we didn't see the fish expected, but this was beyond their control. As a result, we cut the snorkeling short and headed to one of the other islands. Whilst on the island we were guided up a steep hill to one of the viewing areas - a difficult walk, but worth it! Following this, we had lunch which was particularly good.Without rambling on too much more, the tour included stops on the beach, a trip to the lagoon (the one which inspired the book 'The Beach') and kayaking. All of which were fantastically organised. There was an almost endless supply of the water and soft drinks, with the crew offering these to the guests frequently.A big thank you to the 100 Degrees East team."}

The staff is very friendly and helpful. However, the difference between a 5 star hotel and this establishment are the little details. We had two rooms and when we arrived I asked if one of them had twin beds as noted in my reservation, I was ensured several times that this was the case, however when we arrived to the room there were no twin beds. I had to go back to the reception and ask again for the twin beds. Later that evening I had a message in my room from the reception desk for Mrs. Smith, letting me know that I had left behind my reading glasses and something else in the tour operator’s car and I could pick it up at the reception desk. This is very nice, the only problem I am not Mrs. Smith. The next day in the evening I had another message that we could not quite understand, but we could tell that it was not for us either. I went to the reception desk and they were also not sure what the message was about and for whom it was. These little mishaps did not really bother me or spoiled my vacation in any way, however it is the little details that make the difference between 4 and 5 stars. In any case, wew loved our stay here and we can recommend it 100%."}

We booked with Happy Samui due to the lack of available last minutes tours, and the availability of a tour departing in the morning.Happy Samui as a tour company isn't anything different to most tours operating in Koh Samui in that it goes to the same limited 'attractions' as every other tour. Other than a nice viewing area, most are tourist traps which have limited actual sights to look at and mostly include a load of touristy markets. Although no reflection on the tour itself, the tour brochure basically shows you what you will see. As noted by other reviews, the tour has a guide between two buses traversing the same route with a little bit of information at each destination, but by no means extensive. It would have been good to have some commentary on the way, but I don't think think the drivers speak English (which would have helped!) One of the main issues we had with the way the tour is run itself was the amount of time at each place. A few of the stops were excessive for the amount of stuff to see, particularly the first stop at one of the temples and the later stop to waterfall. At both stops we found ourselves waiting at the bus for a while. In the case of the waterfall stop, it wasn't clear that members of the group would be going on elephants, as this wasn't an option in brochure - this wasted further time."}

Despite the distance between the hotel and Ubud, the reviews appeared to justify staying at the hotel.I was quite surprised that the hotel is as small as it (about 20 rooms) and is very well staffed. Besides the daily room and clean, the staff also make the beds in the afternoon ( a nice little touch). We stayed in one of the second storey rooms overlooking the pool (by the restaurant), with the room being very spacious and laid out. The balcony was a decent size and provide a nice view of the pool and the nearby temple.As others have previously noted, the hotel is a bit out of the way and isn't close to any restaurants or bars within walking distance. The hotel restaurant provides a decent selection of main meals, and compared to some hotels, is quite reasonably. The included breakfast isn't the buffet you get so often in hotels, but a made to order set menu (about 4 or 5 options to choose from, including American, Continental and Indonesian) which includes fruit and pastries, and of course, the amazing Balinese coffee. The free afternoon tea put on in the afternoon was a particular highlight.The one issue we had with the Puri Gannga was the cockerels. Although it is established through other reviews on TripAdvisor that the cockerels are an issue, it's .not until you stay in this hotel that you realise the gravity of this nuisance. If it was a 6:30/7am wake-up call, you wouldn't mind, but the noise at 3am wasn't great. Perhaps the hotel could consider ways to mitigate this issue, particularly given the proximity to rooms and the fact that people don't generally appreciate early wake up calls when on their holidays.The free shuttle bus to and from Ubud was great, and well utilised by us. Most of the time we were the only people being dropped off or picked up.Overall a highly recommended hotel, minus those birds!\n\n\nRoom Tip: Try to book a room away from the chook pen!\nSee more room tips"}

I also found the park to be very small. We have near my home (in Germany) an amusement park that is probably 3 to 4 times bigger, with 11 roller-coaster, plus several other attractions.

The hotel is very nice and could not be in a better location. You are right in the center of Lisbon and close to everything. The staff is terrific, very accommodating and helpful. However, the rooms at this hotel are very small, even for European standards. We were two adults with two suitcase and two carry-ons and there was hardly any space in the room. There is no closet as such, basically there is a whole in the wall with a few shelves. The bathroom is OK, but again. As soon that you open the door to the bathroom it became very small. I really liked every else about this place, but just because of the size of the rooms I would not stay here again."}

They have 8 very good dancers, one singer who sang two songs as he was a bit sick on that night and one group that plays traditional Andean music (must say they were spectacular). We did not have the dinner, so I cannot comment on that. Two drinks were included in our package. They give you to choose from champagne, wine and beer. They don’t serve you premium brands, but it was OK. The service was very attentive and nice and yes, at the end of the show she is asking for tips.

The specialty of the house is the fondue, however since I live in Switzerland I chose not to have fondue in Argentina. We ordered as a starter fried calamari. They were a bit hard but OK. Then, as I main course, me and my friend decided to go with the Lam. It was advertised on the menu as “grilled rack of lamb with rustic potatoes and green beans”. What we got was rack of lamb, with some sort of very sweet red wine reduction sauce and potatoes. The green beans were nowhere to be found. The rack of lamb was full of fat, but it didn’t matter because the sauce was so sweet that we were not able to eat our lamb. On top of this, the service was quite slow. It took 15 minutes to get three Caipirinhas. But the worst was that suddenly one cockroach start walking across out table. We mentioned this to our Waiter who wiped the cockroach away with a napkin. Soon after another cockroach crossed our table. Needleless to say that with the cockroaches on our table and the very sweet sauce (that we did not order), our appetite was gone and we left the building very disappointed."}

The rice was hard and the seafood looked like frozen mix seafood out of one of this bags that you can get in the frozen section in any supermarket. Not the kind of seafood I was expected in Buzios. But the worst part was the service. We arrived at the restaurant shortly after 7pm and it took nearly 20 minutes for somebody to come and take our order. While taking our order, we explain to the Waitress that we are in a rush as we had to be somewhere else at 9:30pm. The appetizers came very quick which made us believe that she understood that we were in a hurry. We were wrong. Our main course was served at 9pm!! Despite the fact that we asked at least three time for our entrees, it took nearly 2 hours for our main course to be served. We had to swallow down our meal in 15 minutes. I will probably never go back to this place. If you are worry about the view, there is plenty restaurants on the same street with exact the identical view."}

It is a fantastic place to enjoy a day with the family. In fact, I believe that today one day is not enough to enjoy the park as there is so much to do and see. They have plenty rides for younger kids and then they have the most exciting rides for older kids and adults (13 different roller coasters). I believe there is something for everyone here. Even if you go with elderly people, you can just walk around the park and take one of the slower rides on the water. In my opinion everything is beautifully done. I do not understand the comments about having to stand in line for one or two hours. Let me tell you that I have been to this park in any season of the year, with rain and sunshine and there were times we waited hours to get on the better rides and there were days (due to the weather conditions) that nobody was in the park and therefore no lines. If you chose to go to Europa-Park on a Sunday, in summer, during school Holidays, Christmas or Halloween, you are most luckily to encounter long lines. Try to go on a week day when it is raining. I guarantee you the park will be much less crowded. The entrance fee is about 40 euros but then all the rides and shows inside are free. In my opinion this is not a bad deal. The food is overpriced amusement park food. I have never been to any amusement park, Water Park, or any kind of park where the food was cheap and good. However, you have the option to bring your own food. We have often taken our own sandwiches and drinks that we have purchased in a supermarket at home. Certainly a much cheaper option. I would recommend this park to anyone at any time as it is a great way to spend the day, in fact, I’m already planning my next trip there."}

We found the prices to be very fair for a city like Basel, and really enjoyed the fact that the music was just at the right level so we could enjoy our conversation. They have a great selections of beers. Zoran, the owner, is a great bartender super professional and makes the best cocktails in Basel. We were all so happy, we can’t wait to visit again. They also function as a sports game when any important game is on. Perfect place for a great night with friends. I guarantee you that once you come here for the first time you will become a regular.

There is also a MTR station in the mall and there is another MTR station about 10 minutes’ walk from the hotel. They have a very well equipped gym and a nice pool with a Jacuzzi.

Service was very attentive and polite. We ordered 5 appetizers to share so we could all try them. They were good but to be honest nothing to rave about. We also ordered the artisanal bread which was outstanding, to die for. After that we all ordered our main course. I had the pasta with the vongole and I have to say this was one of the worst pastas I ever had. The pasta was all stick together and looked like a sort of ball on my plate soaked in the white wine sauce; you could actually lift the whole pasta ball just with your fork. The vongole were tasty but were also stick to the shells which made it quite difficult to separate the meat from the shell. I’m guessing here they were overcooked. The pasta had no taste what so ever, completely insipid, I think there was not even salt on this pasta. My colleague had the aubergine parmigiana which came with garlic bread. We asked the waiter if we could have a separate portion of garlic bread, which we were willing to pay for, but apparently this was not possible in this establishment. You had to order the whole dish in order to get the garlic bread. I did try the garlic bread on my friend’s plate and let me tell you that this was also the worst garlic bread I ever tasted. It was very insipid as well, I believe they forgot the salt here too, so we were quite happy we did not order extra garlic bread. On the bright side the cocktails and the wine we ordered were very good. Not sure if Jamie Oliver would be proud to put his name on some of this dishes being such a foodie in his show."}

The rooms are not bad and clean. I thought the room for four was quite small but Ok. There is a kitchen were you can cook your own meals, but the supermarket next door does not really carry many items (not the hotel's fault). The staff on the other hand seamed bothered every time we aproached them. We booked a room for four, two single beds and two bunk beds. When we arrived the top bunk bed was not made. But we had sheets in order to make it ourselves. The next day, again there beds were made except for the top bunk. When I pointed out to the lady at the reception desk that our fourth bed was not made, we were informed that they don't make the top bunk (???). I explain to the young lady that I was just in salzburg in the same hotel and all beds were made at all times. The answer was that they make thinks differently in Vienna (???). I understand that certain hostels have rules like you have to rent towels, rent sheets or that you have to make your own bed. Nevertheless, I did never experience that they would make three beds and not the fourth one. I still don't know the reason for that. Funny enough our last day the whole room was not made. We didn't ask the reception why, but since it was a Sunday we assumed this was the reason. But we are not sure. Also, the Internet was the worst that we experienced during our Europe trip. It would not work in the room nor in the lobby. The only good think about this place is the location. You are very close to metro number 4 that takes you pretty much everywhere in Vienna."}

Basically we were told that we are blocking her way and we could not stay there at the bar (this was the place we were given by the owner). A little bit upset because of her manners we moved to another side of the bar. Then she came back and asked if we wish to eat at the bar which we declined. She informed us that she does not know how long it would take to get a table as she had other people waiting before us (nobody else was waiting in the restaurant besides us). This young waitress really left a bad test in our mounth as she was talking quite rudely to us. We were ready to just walk off. Nevertheless, we finally got our table.

I think this to be very odd as anybody could have done the check-in on my behalf. Our room turned out to be very hot, so I went down to the reception and asked the person in charge if there is anything they could do. I was told to come back the next day as he was alone (not really my problem) and there was nothing he could do. The next morning I went down and spoke to a different gentleman. This time I was told to turn the heater down. When I explained this was the first thing we did and perhaps there is another problem, he said well if the heater is down there is nothing he could do \"just open the window \" (???). At the same time I informed him that our toilet is not flashing properly. At this time he was already looking at me like I was giving him hard time. He said he will send someone but never wrote my room number down. Needless to say the toilet was never fixed during our stay. Breakfast is a different story. The breakfast is not bad. They give you two choices, either continental or English breakfast with coffee, tea and jus. Quite good. But the ladies working there they just don't want to be there. They never smile and if you enter the breakfast room without being called they almost bark at you \"wait outside \". Apparently since they have so many guests you are not allowed to enter the room until they call you. Since there is no sign anywhere, nobody knows, and everybody enters the room the first time without being called. I suggest they sound put a sign up. As I said I would not mind staying in this place due to the cheap price, but the staff has a long way to go. By the way, Internet was not working properly in the room, this is the reason why you will see many people with devices in the corridors."}

She was lovely enough to even give us a suite on the other La Siesta Hotel at no extra cost but we were too tired from the flight and politely declined it, only because we were too lazy to transfer.The room space is enough though not as big as others I've been to. Good air-conditioning. I love the hotel's location because you will see a lot of shops but not close enough to backpacker's area so it's not too loud at night but not too far from happenings.

This is fine with us as we generally like to be on our own. The room for four people was quite tiny but clean. The breakfast as mentioned in other comments could use some improvement. Perhaps a toaster in order to toast the bread will be nice. The location of the hostel is great.

The water in the shower had not much pressure, but as we never complaint about it I’m not sure if this could have been fixed. We got a deal through one web page and for what we paid we thought it was perfect. We even had a superior room, without even knowing it which included Internet.

You had everything you need, if you wanted a fried egg or eggs Benedict you could have it as well but had to pay a small fee. Also, the reception staff was very friendly and helpful. They answered all our questions without any problems. The hotel was right in front of a tram station which was very convenient as the old town was about 10 minutes by tram away.

Reservations: A bit of a hassle if you contacted directly because signal is weak. Best if booked with agoda. You can still message owner with complete details and expect a worry free reservation once you bank transfer. Dont expect confirmation if signal is weak, even if you call, just bring your deposit slip on time of arrival. You'll be surprised even your requested room has been taken cared of. Rooms:Very very soo much spacious! We rent a room for two and they gave us 2 queen size bed in one room. Socket near head rest. Hot shower. Table. 2 chairs. Wooden design, ceiling, wall. No fan or AC but not needed. RatesThe best of its kind. Cheapest of its kind. Value for money. Extra charge for towel so budget travelers must bring own towel. But 1 room has 4 pillows 2 comforters 2 bed sheets, 2 beds. LocationNear lemon pie house and downtown sagada. But if you carry lots of bag might be tiring til you reach bus terminal. Overall excellent location. And a nice view from the balcony. Special req'sI texted if i can have room number 1 because it is the corner room with balcony and near lobby.

Restaurant inside the hotel but the food is cooked on the adjacent resto outside the hotel so you can go at the outside resto directly instead ordering in the hotel as it costs extra and takes more time bringing the food inside the hotel.

Food choices (free bfast) ranges from french toast with egg and fruits to pinoy \"silog\", includes free coffee or fruit juice. Airport transfers - 1 of 5 of us is leaving on an earlier date and the driver is very kind to give all of us 5 a free ride to the airport and drop us there to send our friend goodbye. Next day, he still happily sent us again to airport.**that day a group of Americans and EUs are going back to airport as well. They were earlier and the car is still in airport but they are so assistive in getting a new car, I think it's more of a family car just to have us not waiting for the American's car to go back. This seldom happens in Bohol. When you're a Filipino traveler, you're discriminated. Vest was different. Excellent service on all guests!Special req's - We bought Kings longganisa in the supermarket late at night (pretty famous in cebu and bohol) and Estelle was very kind to ask their chef not to leave yet and have it cooked. It was delivered on our room with no extra charge! But it has to be charged. But wasn't. Price - good large discounts if you're staying for more than 3nights. Otherwise it's a bit higher compare to other Bohol hotels but definitely value for your money. Location - excellent strategic location not too close to centre so it wasn't noisy but not too far. Its a good walk to ATMs, malls, restos and nearby stores for unexpected needs. Rooms- clean, complete toiletries, choice of new towels just leave it on the floor if you want new one. They clean the room nicely. Spacious rooms. Lots of socket, with ref, AC, wifi. I'd go back here!"}

It is a good tour but I’m sure that it will be even better with more information about the places we visited. Ant the third tour was guided by Daniela. She was again a great guide. Very enthusiastic and caring. All tours were well put together and we had a great time."}

We started by ordering some Margaritas and when the drinks arrived they did not taste like Margaritas at all. It seemed that they poured some Ginger Ale in it or something similar. We called the Waiter to let him know that we did not like our drinks and he was very nice and changed them. We opted for beers instead. We decide to order all three of us the “Rice Table”. The soup arrived very quickly and it was quite tasty, too bad it was not hot. After the soup we waited at least 30 minutes for our main course to arrive. The rice table is a combination of several dishes. We had mainly chicken and pork, one fish dish, one shrimp dis and I believe that we had also one beef dish. It comes with several vegetables and salads. I’m certain that the food would have tasted better if it would have been hot as again our food was lukewarm. The food was OK but it was not WOW. The service was great, as I mentioned before when we complained about our drinks they changed it right the way, no questions asked. The fried rice comes with bacon which I’m not a fan of, but I did not ask to have some aside for myself without bacon. However, as soon that the waitress realized that I did not eat bacon, she offered herself to go to the kitchen and get me a new fried rice. This time the rice was hot. Was the service slow? Probably it was for European standards, but not for Caribbean standards. In my opinion the service was great, but they have to improve their food quality."}

The place is an old underground bodega which I thought it was a very original idea to have a restaurant. It is quite dark and very mystic. Old and no windows. As we were a group of 5 adults and 2 kids we got a table that was in a room bit itself. Away from the other guests and very private. We loved it been on our own. The service was very attentive and answered all our questions patiently. They also were very good with the kids. As a starter we tried several of the items to share “cecina de buey” (typical for Leon), “grilled peppers”, “grilled vegetables”, “chorizo”, etc. I must say everything was excellent. As a main course four of us had the famous beef and one had fish. The chef himself comes and presents you the beef and tells you right the way how many kilos it has (I guess so you can start doing the calculations how much the bill will be). Ours was about two kilos and something. Later the chef himself comes back when the meat is prepared and cuts the meat in front of you. After all the fat and the bones are gone there is not much left. Nevertheless, it was enough for us and the meat was excellent. I did not think the chef (who is the owner of the place) was very friendly, probably because he does all the cutting and presenting of the meat so he has not much time to interact with the guests. He comes, does his job and leaves again. Is this a special place? Yes. Did I enjoy the food and the service while I was there? Very much. Does it justify the 700 euros we paid (with wine and dessert)? Not at all. It is an unusual place and I’m glad I went and got to experience it, however even though the meat was great it does not justify the 70 euros that you pay per kilo. Especially when you see that most of it is fat and bones. I cannot say that I would not recommend it as it is a great place, just be aware of the prices."}

We were seated on a table that napkins and knifes were missing. We did not receive our napkins until our starters were on the table and we had to ask for it. You have 4 or 5 waiters walking around but it seems that no one is really responsible for your table. At least we had 4 different people serving our table. One of the gentlemen (he seemed in charge of the wines) when we asked about a wine recommendation he just rolled the eyes and said we should take the house wine. Not the answer we were looking for. As I mentioned in previous reviews, when you are to certain restaurants and you are paying a certain price, service is as important as the food. I felt like in this place the wait staff does not make you feel welcome. In my opinion a big disappointment."}

You could not taste the soup at all. The second dish was melon with prosciutto. The melon and the prosciutto were so thinly cut that you could hardly see them on the plate. The main course I have to say was OK and the dessert again was a disaster. We had a raspberry gratin, but it was so sweet that we were unable to eat it.

He stated again that he called a taxi for 7pm to take us to the bus station and everything is fine. At 7pm we were ready to leave; he arrived with the tickets and basically rushed us into the taxi. On our way to the bus station we opened the tickets and realized that the tickets were 90 soles per person and not 110 (we were 4 people). Now we understood why he was not interested in us seeing the tickets before. I have to admit it was our own stupidity and we should have insisted more in getting the tickets earlier…he seemed so nice and polite. Based on our above experience I cannot recommend this place. Should you still choose to spend your time here, be aware and careful with Daniel. He will sell you a city tour that costs 22 soles (you can get it in other travel agencies for 12 soles); he will also try to sell you a tour to Valle Sagrado for 33 soles (you can get it somewhere else for 23 soles)."}

The idea of my friends was that I enjoy a nice relaxing day. As per the publicity half of the place was for family for kids and the other half was for adults without kids that would like to relax and enjoy themselves. I went early on a week day (it was not a school holyday week) and the place was full with parents and their children. It is true that half of the establishment is to relax and the other half is for children with toboggans, however the kids would run everywhere, in the adult part and in the kid’s part. There is no separation between the kids and the adult’s part; no way you can relax if you are traveling without kids. I do love kids and I don’t mind them running around, but sometimes I choose to go in a place where I want to relax without children (according to the publicity this is what it was). Nevertheless, they have a great kid’s free sauna area. If you have kids this is a great place to go on a rainy day."}

This gentleman first of all brought us two menus for a table of five. When I asked him if we could have another menu he said “it’s on the table”. So the five of us had to share two menus. Then we ordered water, a bottle of white wine and some beers. They did not have draft beer so he brought us two bottles of beers, but no beer glasses. We had to use the water glasses for the beer as well. The wine was not served it was just placed in the middle of the table with no bucket of ice in order to remain cold. We had to ask for the ice separately and we had to serve the wine ourselves. Then he forgot one of the main dishes, and when we asked for it he said that we had cancelled it. Instead being apologetic, he blamed it on us that one dish was missing. Maybe it was a misunderstanding, however this is the first time that I was told by a waiter “this is your fault”. The restaurant was lovely and the food very good, but this was one of the worst service experiences that I had and because of this I will not return to this place. I forgot to mention that they were only two tables in the restaurant, so there is not excused for such a service."}

We had as a starter, the special of the day, which was three prawns, cooked each one in a different way. The taste of each prawn was incredible. After that we had spaghetti with local fish ragout, this dish was also very good but maybe my least favorite from all we had, although it was very good as well. For some people it might be a little bit too fishy. And our third dish was a green asparagus risotto with a breaded sea-bream on top. As dessert we had a sample of several desserts. I have to say the menu is not very big and I thought they could have a little bit more choices, however I’m sure that if you don’t find anything on the menu that pleases you they will find the way to make your happy. In regards to the service I have to say that it was a little bit disappointing for a restaurant like this. All of the service staff was very nice and friendly, this was not the problem, it was just the little details that were missing. Let’s start when we entered the hotel, we were greeted in a very polite manner by the General Manager, by the Maitre D’ and by all the service personal. They all escorted us to our table…but no one took our jackets. Our jackets and scarfs were lying behind everybody’s chair for the whole evening. Now, if I’m in a pizzeria I don’t expect anybody to take my jacket, but in an establishment like this I believe that it is a must. No chairs were pulled back for the ladies when we sat down, we had to constantly remind them to refill our glasses with water or wine. In regards to the glasses, every time the Waiter placed wine glasses on the table instead placing them from the right side like he supposed to, he would put his arm in front of my face in order to place the glass for my table companion on my left side. He also would hold the glasses by the top of the glass (where you put your lips on) instead by the bottom. Another small think that I notice is that there was no bread basked to choose bread from. We got a regular bread roll (very fresh, warm and crispy I have to say) and no butter. I’m not sure if no serving butter with the bread is something that they do in this restaurant or they simply forgot. However, in most of the restaurant that I have been to (expensive and less expensive) they serve you butter or something else with the bread. This are all small details (some of them are simple service rules) that I would not care about if I go in a different type of restaurant, but here were we paid for 5 people over 700 euro I expect a little bit more attention to detail. Nevertheless it was a great evening and I would recommend this restaurant any time."}

One of the dishes came out wrong, they reluctantly changed it after the manager was informed. The fruit juice we order came incorrectly and they refused to change it.The restaurant is also expensive, and unfortunately the money you pay is definitely not worth what you get in exchange.Id go back to the location but i could definitely live without the restaurant.

The service is very attentive and polite and before they even served my beef tartare, they brought me a sample so I could decide if it was spiced to my test or not.

I was flying to Lembongan from the UK to do my DM and i wanted to stay between 6 and 7 weeks, so before i committed to a particular dive center i research and emailed almost all of the dive centers on the island, this was easier said than done, however the folks at legend were very quick with their responses and they all made sense as they speak very good English (not the case with all of the centers).Price wise they are not the cheapest on the island for the Divemaster internship but they aren't the most expensive. However they are the newest, so all the gear is less than a year old and in very good condition, the boat they use is also new and in good condition. The price you pay is definitely worth the service you get!The guides and instructors are very friendly, knowledgeable and were all willing to help me out with my studies. It was a very good blend of professionalism and enjoyment. There is a guide for every type of person, Harli has eagle vision and can spot just about anything and everything providing its there. I put Yeray under a bit of pressure as i was worried about the currents but he reassured me and kept me from getting into a situation i wouldn't be comfortable in. Jessie is more \"by the book\" and a bit less flexible than the others but i imagine she would be ideal for beginners and people that are worried - she even saved my behind once as i got caught by the current, she made me feel very safe.The rest of the staff are also great, the captain (Nurata – I hope I spelt that right), the boat hands, the additional people at the shop, they were all happy to help where and when they could.The owners/managers, Ricky and Isabel, were very helpful, they helped me out with everything from the doctor, to places to eat, to accommodation, the whole 9 yards, i couldnt have asked for more. AND because i finished my Divemaster course a couple of days early i was even promised a couple of dives FOC when i was next on the island, which is very kind of them.The Divemaster course itself was paced out to suit me. I took days off when I felt like it and there wasn’t any issues. Thankfully Legend was happy to have me in the water as much as possible, which I massively prefer to being in the classroom. The classroom sessions were also flexible. I was wary when I intitially started looking for dive centers, I wanted people who wanted me to get it right rather than just take my money and have a relaxed attitude to my learning. Overall it was a really good course and im a better diver now than I was before I went.The next time im in Bali I will go back and dive with Legend. I’d recommend them to anyone and everyone. Should I want to become an instructor in the future, I will specifically go back and do it with Legend. It was an all-round excellent experience!Thanks Legend!"}

I had instead the sautéed shrimps with garlic and wine sauce. The shrimps were frozen, however they prepare them so well and so tasty that we didn’t mind. My fiancé ordered the Bruschettas with Funghi, zucchini and parmesan cheese, mozzarela, tomato and basil which turned out to be an excellent choice as well. I had as a main course spaghetti vongole and they were just like spaghetti supposed to be...al dente. Great. And my partner ordered Roasted fillet of fish, shrimps, coquille st. Jacques \u0026 sauteed potatoes. The fish and the coquille st. Jacques were very fresh and very delicious. Huge portions to. We are not much of dessert persons so we finished our evening with a nice glass of porto. You will not find any tourist in this restaurant.

The hotel has a very good location, right in front of the beautiful beach and near restaurants and bars. There was however a few issues that I would like to mention here. First of all it seems that the maintenance of the room wasn’t done in a long time. A few shelves on the roof were broken and there was mold in our bathtub, but the room was very clean. We had everyday a breakfast buffet up on deck 15 with a beautiful view. In my opinion the choices on the breakfast buffet where very little for a hotel this category and almost every day the same. They have a small but nice Spa area equipped with a gym corner and a Jacuzzi. One night we tried to use the Jacuzzi but I was so hot that we could not even enter the Jacuzzi. The lady in charged apologized and blamed it on the maintenance people and she said she will report it and have somebody call us to apologize. Nobody ever called us. Another day I made an appointment for a pedicure and as I showed up for my treatment the lady who was supposed to do the pedicure was not here yet. The receptionist told me to wait a few minutes she is trying to get hold of the lady. After 20 minutes of waiting I decided I don’t need a pedicure anymore. Again here nobody called to give us an explanation or to apologize. At the reception desk most of the employees were very friendly, but there was a certain gentleman that had a problem attitude. Every time we asked him for things (second bathrobe in room, Internet not working, etc.) he never solved the problem. The Terrado Suites has also two restaurants. We ate several times for lunch and dinner in both of them and I have to say the food and the service is fantastic. I also would like to make a special mention to the bellboys, they do a terrific job; always nice and ready to help.And now to finish I would like to mention a little incident that will not make us go back to Terrado Suite. One day I was looking for some money in my wallet and realized that $200 were missing. I know exactly how much money was in my purse. We didn’t mention anything to the reception because we are aware that this is our own fault since the room has a safe, but we never thought that something like this would happen in a hotel this category."}

Already since a few years we were talking about Restaurant Charon which has a very good reputation. Finally a few weeks ago we decided to go for dinner. The food was excellent, but if I’m going to have dinner in a certain type of restaurant and I know what I’m going to pay for it I expect the service and the little details to be as good as the food. Let me start with the reservation, I called the restaurant to reserve a table for two and when I was asked what time we would like to go for dinner, my friend said 9pm. Leaving in Switzerland I’m very well aware that this is late so I said 8:30pm and apparently the gentleman on the other side overhear the conversation with my friend and probably to ensure we are not going to be too late he stated in an very arrogant ton of voice “but no later that this”. Not the type of service that I expected to receive, however we decided to keep our reservation. The first think that we realized was the set up of the table. There was a regular wine glass, nothing special; and the water glass. Now, the water glass had publicity written on it from the mineral water “Eptinger” which means that they received them for free since they are ordering this type of mineral water. Nothing wrong with it, but I would expect something with a little bit more class in a restaurant this category. As we ordered the bottle of wine I thought the waiter may change the glasses since it was one of the more expensive bottles of wines. I don’t expect to have riedel glasses o the table but some nice wine glasses to enjoy my wine, he left the ones that were on the table. He brought the bottle of wine as I was still drinking my aperitif and I was given the wine to taste. The wine was left on our table instead on the side table. The bread basked was a sort of a bambus basket with 4 slices of bread on it and was placed in the middle of the table, cheap in my opinion, again, for a restaurant like this I would expect the waiter to serve the bread. I ordered a beautiful sole, which was placed in front of me just like that, no deboned by the waiter. I think when you pay 52sfr (around $48) for a sole I can expect the waiter to debone it for me. You know how it is when two girls haven’t seeing each other for a while, they go out together and never stop talking. Well, this was our case and I had the feeling that the waiter was in a rush, he served our table very fast and he was always walking around to see if we are ready to pay. Another think that I notice is that the boss of the restaurant himself used to bring the bill to every single table, except for us. I don’t know if he was already gone by that time we finished but we felt like we were not good enough for him to bring us the bill, not important, but attention to detail. And the last think that happened to us and that I never saw in any place that I have been is that when we asked for the bill the waiter was already changed and brought as the bill in jeans and shirt, like I said, he was in a rush. I know all of this review mind sound a little bit snob, but I can ensure you that I’m not snob at all. We paid almost 400sfr (370$) for this dinner, this is a lot of money. I know exactly when I’m going to a restaurant what I’m going to pay and I don’t mind, but I know also what I can expect. If I want cheap chinaware and a service that is in rush, I can save a lot of money and have dinner in a different type of restaurant. The food as I say was excellent. If you don’t care about service, proper wine glasses and little details like me, then the Restaurant Charon is perfectly fine."}

They also have a great wine list. Almost forgot dessert, i had some kind of triple chocolate stack, again, it was fantastic.We had to wait an hour and ten minutes for a table, however we were told that this was a short wait! but we were led upstairs to the bar, had a few cocktails and some finger food and were on our way. do not let the wait put you off!the service was great, friendly, helpful an polite.Well worth a visit!"}

It was my first time diving in an aquarium and its well worth the experience. Our dive master was a guy named Dick, he was from England so there was no trouble with a language barrier, he was very patient and friendly, everything you want from someone guiding you through the waters. On top of all of that, it was a half day thing, rather than a boat taking you out to see for an hour and then an hour back, we got 2 dives in half a day and were back at the hotel in 15 minutes, it was only me and my buddy in the tank so no one else was getting in the way, I thoroughly recommend it. You also get free entry included to the aquarium so you can also have a wonder about once you're done."}

Perhaps it is important to distinguish that this is a game farm and not a reserve and any expectations need to be constrained by this. The farm is a mix of grazing plains from the previous cattle farm (7 years ago it was converted) and fynbos scrublands. During the drive you will see most species of the animals kept on the farm including several exotic species like emus and fallow deer. The animals we encountered were quite skittish and as such we were not able to get very close before they moved away often running away. The wind on the open back vehicle can be quite chilly so dress warmly. The spring flowers usually associated with the West Coast should full bloom in this area by the end of August as they were just starting when we visited."}

On eventual arrival the order was incorrect on two of our three meals and we sent one order back to the kitchen. My meal arrived back out and again was wrong so I sent it back again and on the third delivery, unbelievably it was still wrong. The floor manager apologized profusely and offered a complimentary coffee while I waited for the 4th attempt to arrive which it eventually did, an hour and twenty minutes after placing my order and long after my family had finished their meals.

We drove to Private Taxi Transfer point and opted for the premium package including BBQ lunch with drinks, speedboat the waterfall and of course time on the island. I feel that our package was a good deal and we opted for an extra parasailing excursion which was thrilling and very well organized and safe. The views here are what you imagine a Mauritius postcard to look like. The speedboat ride cuts down your travel time, so in my opinion is worth a little extra. The waterfall is not spectacular but we enjoyed the ride and seeing the monkeys was a bonus. The lunch was basic with a combo of chicken and fish or just one if you prefer. The complimentary rum made the remainder of the afternoon very pleasant. The last water taxi back was at 4pm and we couldn't believe how time flew by. Everything else is expensive and extra including beach lounge and drinks on the main island, so take a little picnic bag with you along with beach mats and towels to add to your comfort. Don't forget sun cream."}

A small kitchenette with all the utensils needed to do your own cooking, a comfortable double bed with a large en suite plus a sleeper couch if needed. The view from the balcony was raised and so overlooked the beach trees giving stunning opportunities to see the giant fruit bats (flying foxes) and the little beach in front of the apartments over the main road is a gem on its own. The Surfers Restaurant directly in front of the apartments offers lunch and dinner options with a varied menu and even breakfast on request. Otherwise, there are plenty of supermarkets within 5 minutes drive to stock up on food supplies. My wife and I both felt we could easily return to this beautiful spot. It is situated on the south eastern tip of the island about 20 minutes drive from the airport along the main coastal road. It is definitely away from the main tourist areas which for us is a bonus. The staff are friendly and helpful. Highly recommended and will definitely return."}

Patricia, the owner, greeted us on arrival and made sure we were looked after. The beach is just steps away and the soft splash of the ocean adds even more of a romantic atmosphere. The service was attentive and although not everything was available on the menu, alternatives were suggested. For starters I had Grilled Camembert, mains Prawn \u0026 Chicken curry and creme brûlée for dessert, all of which was excellent. A live duo played music which was just the right volume not to intrude on conversation, but certainly added to the already romantic atmosphere. The prices match a fine dining experience so this should be considered a special night out rather than just casual fare, but you get what you pay for. Will recommend and will be back."}

I have over 400 plus reviews and have travelled extensively and every once of my being says AVOID this operator at all costs. First we tried to book online and sent an email which was never answered. We persevered as a family member had recommended them. We finally went to their office near Sunset Boulevard midweek and made a booking in person. The sales pitch was quite strong leaning on them claiming their boat offers fewer numbers and better customer service than their competitors. Despite being about €10 more expensive than other operators we had seen, we opted to confirm the booking. It was explained to us that this was low season and as such they were only sailing on the Friday - the last day of our week long vacation. We gave our names and a contact telephone number as required. On Friday morning we arrived at the meeting point on time to find the office was closed and remained so for the next 20 minutes. Eventually a man in a car pulled up outside and shouted to us that the boat trip was cancelled and sped off before we could engage. We waited for another 10 minutes hoping someone could assist us but eventually gave up and left. We drove the coastal road looking for other operators but pardon the pun, we had missed the boat and clearly placed our faith in the wrong operator. I am sure, as previous reviews suggest, when they do run the service they may well give a great experience but they way in which our booking was handled and then the way we were informed about the cancellation was unprofessional and rude. I would therefore NOT recommend this operator in anyway. This completely spoiled our final day and with no recourse, apology, alternate plan or suggestion or even a decent explanation other than a man shouting at us from a car - leaves a very bitter taste in ones mouth."}

Several British columns crossed the Natal borders into Zulu territory expecting a swift and decisive victory against the perceived underwhelming half naked Zulu army. The central column camped below the magnificent mountain of Isandlwana after crossing at Rorke's Drift under the leadership of Lord Chelmsford who split his force and went in search of the main Zulu army with most of his men. Those left at camp were slaughtered by the Zulu Army who although were technically ill equipped made up for this in sheer numbers.

It's difficult to put this boutique hotel into any category and rather it shines on its own. It is at heart a boutique hotel, but its soul is an eclectic mix of contemporary and traditional African art without any thought to conventional norm in the display thereof. Every room is its own gallery and the main hall is something to see to believe. You could easily spend hours just wandering the place as every nook and cranny is decorated with African art but there is definitely a Balinese influence too. The Gardens are just as fun to wander and the main pool/patio area has stunning views over the gorge. The rooms are huge and for this stay I booked an executive suite but perhaps this was overkill and if I stay again it will be a smaller room as the bigger room really is excessive with separate lounge, massive patio, kitchenette, hallway and an amazingly large and comfortable bathroom. The manager, Alta was very polite and attentive without being obtrusive and her breakfast was top drawer. As other reviewers have commented, beware the driveway. It is definitely not for the feint hearted. My only criticism (but I haven't marked it down as I knew this beforehand) is that there is no bar or meal service onsite. It would have been nice to enjoy a Gin \u0026 Tonic while we enjoyed the sunset, but there is a fridge in the room, so bring your own."}

Most of our table ordered burgers which seemed to average around the R100 with fries. The plates were very nicely presented and food very tasty. We opted to bring our own wine and there was a minimal corkage fee. For dessert we shared waffles and Sundaes which were excellent. There is choice of seating indoors and outdoors, where the latter has gas heaters to keep you warm in a cool winters night. All told, a very pleasant night out and I would definitely visit again."}

My first (and probably only) visit wasn't great. My wife and I opted for breakfast. The food was OK but the service wasn't, making the overall experience poor. It started with the waitress (who never introduced herself nor came across as friendly) spilling my wife's coffee into the saucer while serving making the biscuit soggy. There was no apology or offer to refill. The manager (bald guy who talked on the phone while pacing up and down so assumed him to be the manager) looked bored and yawned several times while in front of patrons without regard for trying to cover it up. This feeling of apathy filtered down to the staff as we noticed that it took some time for waiters to clear and wipe tables after patrons had left. The chair at our table was broken showing splinters on the back rest. The walls were littered with chipped paint from chairs being knocked into the wall. Our empty cups were left on the table well into the meal without any offer for another order and at no time did the waitress or manager enquire as to how our experience was, otherwise I may have advised them directly of my experience rather than resorting to a more formal approach on a restaurant review site. I doubt I'll be back as there are just too many options in the area to have to compromise on friendliness and service,"}

The restaurant lends itself to be upmarket in its pricing, website, service and menu yet the setting is very minimal, casual and staff canteen like. On the night we visited there was an elegantly dressed couple singing lovely music on the outdoor deck which elevates the atmosphere a notch, yet the screams from the mini soccer field next door lower it again. So all that aside - the food and service was good. I had the lamb chops and short rib - sadly there was no rump steak the night we visited. My one negative is that the plates are placed on the tables cold and you dish your meat from a communal platter. On a winter's night especially, the plates should be warmed. Like the name says - it's a braai lounge although the canteen style furniture doesn't imply a lounge at all. Food is served by platter or by weight if you choose to make your own platter - you select from the butcher trays, so don't take your vegetarian friends and family. Be careful though as you pay for the fat and bone too, so the price can elevate quickly. The sides are served in small two bowls ideal for sharing. There are some unusual dishes available not often seen on restaurant menus including 'walkies' - chicken feet. I'm not sure whether this is a novelty or if some clients actually order this. Ultimately, I enjoyed my night out as a novelty once off. I probably would return but perhaps not anytime soon, as it feels to close to a home braai experience without the usual accompaniments. However if you feel like a braai without having to clean up afterwards, then definitely try it."}
